Heat. Heat.
Woo!
Hello namaskar. This is first post and
you're watching Vantage with me Pali
Sharma.
After indiscriminate firing for weeks,
there's talk of a ceasefire in the trade
war. Donald Trump says he may soon have
a deal with China. 3 to four weeks is
what he said. And what has China said.
What will this deal mean for the rest of
the world? We'll discuss that. Among all
those watching will be Nvidia, the chip
giant. They're caught in the crossfire.
Their boss is dining with Trump and
wooing Xi Jinping as he stares at
billions in losses. Meanwhile, Trump is
going after Chinese ships to level the
playing field for American ship
builders. But how did China come to
dominate global
shipping? What do we make of Bangladesh
asking Pakistan to apologize for 1971?
Are they serious? How Google's ad
business is being called out as an
illegal monopoly? How China is fighting
proxy wars by helping the Houthis in
Yemen and arming the Russians in
Ukraine. What's the historic motion in
the Scottish Parliament that talks about
tackling Hindu phobia? Are the US and
Iran close to a nuclear deal? What's
with the English spelling? Why is it so
complicated? Has no one tried to fix it?
And on World Heritage Day, the United
Nations honors the Bhagwat Gita and the
Nati Shastra. All this and more coming
up. The headlines first.
The US threatens to withdraw from the
Ukraine peace talk. Secretary of State
Marco Rubio warns that Washington could
soon exit if no progress is made. Donald
Trump's push for peace has stumbled with
Russian President Vladimir Putin ruling
out a complete truce. Today, Moscow
announced that a 30-day pause on the
strikes on Ukrainian energy sites has
expired. Yemen's Houthi rebels claim
American strikes on an oil port have
killed at least 74 people. More than 150
others have been injured. This is the
deadliest attack by Washington against
the Iranbacked group. The Houthi rebels
vow to retaliate. They claim that they
have targeted two US aircraft carriers
and
Israel. Prime Minister Narendra Modi
speaks to Elon Musk. During the call,
they spoke about the potential
collaborations in the areas of
technology and innovation. The Indian
Prime Minister had met Musk when he
visited the US earlier this year. The
tech billionaire has ambitious plans to
bring Starlink internet services to
India.
US Vice President JD Vance meets Italian
Prime Minister George Maloney in Rome.
The meeting comes just a day after
Maloney met Trump in Washington. This is
Vance's first trip to Europe since he
slammed the block at the Munich Security
Conference in February. Vance will
celebrate Easter at the Vatican with his
family before heading to
India. And Egypt central bank lowers its
interest rate for the first time since
2020. A few days earlier, the government
had announced a reduction in fuel
subsidies. Last week, Cairo raised fuel
prices for the fourth time in a year.
Egypt faces a soaring foreign debt,
which has quadrupled since 2015.
I believe we're going to have a deal
with China.
It's hard to analyze President Trump's
actions. He's so erratic and volatile.
But one good measure is his rhetoric.
That gives you an idea about where he
stands. On his so-called liberation day,
when he announced tariffs on the whole
world, the rhetoric meter was through
the roof. Trump accused other countries
of raping and pillaging America. 15 days
later, the meter has cooled down. He's
been raising tariffs on China like a
monopoly game, but that tit fortat could
be
ending. US President Trump has hinted
that he wouldn't go higher than 245%.
Well, in a certain point, I don't want
them to go higher because at a certain
point, you make it where people don't
buy. So, I may not want to go higher or
I may not want to even go up to that
level. I may want to go to less because
you know you want people to buy and at a
certain point people aren't going to
buy.
Not just that, he's also looking for a
deal. Trump claims that China has
reached out to him for talks and he says
a deal could be struck in weeks. Listen
to this.
Sorry. Has he called you directly,
President Xi, or reached out? Well,
you'd think it was pretty obvious that
he has, but we will talk about that
soon. It's not that important because
honestly we're going to have a deal. I
believe we're going to have a deal with
China. How much time? I would I would
think over the next three or four weeks
I think maybe the whole thing could be
concluded.
3 to four weeks if Trump is serious.
This is good news. But it also exposes
his hand. Just think back to what he
said leading up to the tariffs. That
America had been ripped off. That
America had to bring back jobs. that the
trade deficit had to be wiped out. Can
you strike a deal to solve these
problems in one month? Logic says no.
But Trump may not have an option.
Investors and businesses are questioning
his policy. Elon Musk is distancing
himself. Foreign allies are looking for
other options. So Trump is pretty much
alone here. Not even his central bank is
supporting this campaign. I'm talking
about the US Federal Reserve or the Fed
as they call it. Its chair was appointed
by Trump back in 2018. His name is
Jerome Powell. Now Powell is not a fan
of these tariffs. He says it will raise
inflation and slow down growth.
Unemployment is likely to go up as the
economy slows in all likelihood and
inflation is likely to go up as tariffs
find their way and some part of those
tariffs come to the um come to be paid
by the by the by the public. So that's
the strong likelihood.
Powell was also asked about the stock
markets. Would he intervene if they
collapse too much? The answer was a
resounding no. Needless to say, Trump is
angry about this. He wants the Fed to
lower the interest rates. Only then will
Americans get cheaper loans. Only then
can they spend
freely. But Jerome Powell is in no mood
to do that. He is expecting inflation to
rise. So the last thing on his mind is a
rate cut. Where does that leave Donald
Trump? First, he lashed out on social
media. He said Powell's termination
cannot come fast
enough. His plan is to ask the Fed chief
to resign.
You said that the termination of Jerome
Powell cannot come fast enough. He says
he won't leave even if you ask him to.
Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll
be out of there. I don't think he's
doing the job. He's uh too late. Always
too late. A little slow. And I'm not
happy with him.
Uh, I let him know it and uh Oh, if I
want him out, he'll be out of there real
fast, believe me.
Just one problem, though. Jerome Powell
is not planning to resign after Trump
won in November. He was specifically
asked about this. Would he step aside if
Trump asked him to? Listen to the
response.
Some of the president's elect's advisers
have suggested that you should resign.
Um, if he asked you to leave, would you
go? No. Uh, can you follow up on is Do
you think that legally he you're not
required to leave? No.
So, it's a stalemate. Trump wants Jerome
Powell to leave, but the Fed chief has
no intention of doing so. Then what can
Trump do? Can the president simply fire
him? Many American legal scholars are
debating this. They agree that it's a
gray, untested area, and there is a
reason why. No US president has tried to
fire the Fed chief before. It's a
wellestablished norm. Central banks
operate independently. The government
will not interfere in their
decision-m. And this isn't just true for
America. It's true for most democracies.
So the idea itself is risky and
dangerous. It would undermine confidence
in the US economy. Nonetheless, let's
look at the legality of it. The US
Central Bank is governed by the Federal
Reserve Act. It does allow governors and
board members to be fired, but only with
cause. And what qualifies as a cause?
Misconduct or incapacity. Policy
disagreements do not qualify. So Trump's
move is unlikely to hold up in a court
of law. Plus, the Fed's independence has
bipartisan support. Even some
Republicans may not support such a move
to fire the Fed chief. Another option is
to demote Jerome Powell. You see, the
Fed has seven board members. They're all
nominated by the president for 14 years.
The Fed chair is also a board member.
So, some scholars say that Trump could
demote Powell, basically strip the
chairmanship, but keep him as a member.
Again, this is uncharted territory. The
final decision will likely be taken by
the Supreme Court of the US. In fact,
the court is hearing a similar case
right now. Like the Fed, there are
dozens of independent agencies in the US
government and President Trump has asked
the court whether he can fire
them. Old procedure says he cannot, not
unless there is misconduct or
incapacity. But let's see if the court
sets a new procedent and if they do, it
could boost Trump's
case. The question is at what cost? The
US Fed is the most important central
bank in the world. Other central banks
and bankers take cues from the
Fed. It is also the custodian of gold
reserves belonging to dozens of
countries. So the Fed's independence is
a cornerstone of the US economy. You
take that out, the whole house could
collapse.
Donald Trump has opened a new front in
the US China trade war. The battleground
is artificial intelligence and caught in
the crossfire is
Nvidia, the tech company. It makes the
world's most popular AI chips. It powers
the world's most used AI apps. From Chad
GPT to China's Deep Seek, they all run
on
Nvidia. Apparently, more than 35,000
companies use Nvidia to build AI. And
now Nvidia is at the center of the US
China
rivalry. Their CEO is a man called
Jensen Huang. He has made a major
gamble. Huang has gone to China in the
middle of all of this. He landed in
Beijing yesterday and this trip came out
of the blue. The timing could not have
been worse. A few days ago, Trump issued
an order. He banned Nvidia from selling
a special kind of chip. A chip called
the
H20. Again, this is an AI chip. Nvidia
built it specifically for China. They
built it to evade Joe Biden's export
controls. Remember when Biden was
president, he had banned the sales of
advanced AI chips to China. So the H20,
the H20 chip was a workaround, a less
powerful chip that complied with
America's export
curbs. But then Trump has added to those
curbs and he has effectively banned the
sale of H20 chips to China. These chips
were in huge demand. Chinese tech giants
had played placed large orders for H20.
The likes of Alibaba, Tencent, Bite
Dance, they' all ordered chips worth $18
billion. That's a big chunk of revenue
for Nvidia. 18 billion. Last year, China
accounted for over 17 billion of this
company's
earnings. That's more than 19% of
Nvidia's global earnings. And the
revenue from H20 alone is a billion
dollars higher, 18 billion. So, you can
imagine how much this ban hurts Nvidia.
Their earnings will take a hit, a $5.5
billion
hit. and the full exit will be even more
painful. But that's where we are headed
if Trump has his way. That's right. But
the tariffs will be in place uh in the
notistant future because as you know,
like we did with steel, like we did with
automobiles, like we did with aluminum,
which are now fully on. We'll be doing
that with semiconductors, with chips,
and numerous other things. and we wanted
to uncomplicate it from a lot of other
companies because we want to make our
chips and semiconductors and other
things in our country.
He doesn't want China to get access to
advanced
technology. But the Nvidia boss is not
ready to give up yet. That's Jensen
Huang. He met with Chinese trade groups
and leaders today and he gave them an
assurance. He called China and I'm
quoting a very important market for
Nvidia and he said that he wants to
continue cooperating with Chinese
firms. Chinese mouthpieces have carried
some
quotes. This is what they've said.
Nvidia would spare no effort to build to
build compliant products and
unswervingly serve the Chinese market.
Apparently, that's what Jensen Huang
told the Chinese.
The message was diplomatic, but the
intention was unmistakable. Nvidia is
not walking away. Despite Washington's
restrictions, despite growing scrutiny
from both sides, this company is
exploring options. It is looking to
develop another chip, a new product that
will comply with Trump's new
restrictions. At the same time, Jensen
Huang has been lobbying the US
government. Before the latest crackdown,
he met President Trump. Hang attended a
dinner at Mara Lago. This was an
exclusive event with a price tag of $1
million per
plate. And that same week, Nvidia
committed to massive investments in the
US. It will build two supercomput
factories. Nvidia will spend $500
billion on this. And Trump himself
welcomed the news. Because Nvidia as you
know controls that almost the entire
sector which is one of the most
important sectors in the world between
chips and semiconductors and everything
else and they're they're the biggest
it's it's one of the great companies of
the world modern super modern companies
controls segments that nobody you know
sort of controls the world in a sense
and they're coming in here in the
biggest way with hundreds of billions of
dollars not not like millions of
dollars, hundreds of billions of
dollars, and I'm honored by it.
But Nvidia still needs China for growth.
Before the export curbs, 20% of the
company's revenue came from China. Now
it will go down to 10%. And experts
believe that soon it can fall, and I'm
quoting, to close to
zero. That's going to be a big dent in
Nvidia's bottom line because while the
these AI chips are in high demand,
they're also quite expensive. Only a
handful of markets in the world can
afford these
chips. So, Nvidia is trying to stay in
both camps. But the space for neutrality
is increasingly shrinking. Since last
year, China has been preparing for a
future without Nvidia. Chinese
regulators are advising their tech
companies. The guidance is unofficial,
but it's firm. Avoid Nvidia. Switch to
domestic alternatives. Chinese firms are
being nudged towards homegrown
chips. So the intent is clear on both
sides. America wants to block China's
tech strides and China wants to control
its AI future. A future without
Nvidia. Jensen Huang is keeping a foot
in the door, but he's at the mercy of
President Trump. In this trade war,
there may be no middle ground.
What do cars, computers, and toys have
in common? They all arrive by ship.
Global trade runs on cargo vessels. From
your electronics to your clothes,
high-end machinery for factories, even
the cars you drive, they most likely
come on
ships. 90% 90% of the world's goods are
transported by sea. And most of those
ships are made in China.
Now the US wants to change that. Donald
Trump is going after ships built by
China. Just like his push on trade and
manufacturing, Trump wants to bring ship
building back to America.
We will create a new office of ship
building in the White House and offer
special tax incentives to bring this
industry home to America where it
belongs. We used to make so many ships.
We don't make them anymore very much,
but we're going to make them very fast,
very soon. It will have a huge impact.
So, how will he achieve this goal? By
resorting to the same strategy. He will
impose higher taxes on Chinese-made
ships. Whenever they arrive on American
shores, they will have to pay something
called port
fees. And Trump is hiking this fee
substantially. It's a bold move to tip
the scales of global
trade. And it's already facing a strong
push back. The original plan was quite
ambitious. This is what Trump announced.
A flat fee on Chinese ships up to $3.5
million per ship per visit. $3.5 million
per visit. The plan triggered panic
across US industries. After all, they
depend on ships to get their goods. And
their concerns were all the same. Higher
taxes would lead to inflation. It would
raise prices for all American consumers.
and global shipping companies said the
same thing. So Washington has watered
down this original plan. Fees will now
be calculated on the basis of cargo
weight or the number of containers it is
carrying. And instead of every arrival,
the fee will be charged up to five times
a year. And yes, there is a way to avoid
it altogether. For that, you'll have to
order a ship from an American shipyard,
no Chinese ships, and you'll get the
exemption.
Needless to say, China has criticized
this.
We have previously stated our position
on the relevant issue many times. I
would like to reiterate here that
measures such as levying port fees and
imposing tariffs on cargo handling
equipment are harmful to both sides.
They have not only pushed up global
shipping costs and disrupted the
stability of global supply chain, but
also increased inflationary pressure in
the United States, harmed the interests
of American consumers and companies, and
ultimately failed to revitalize the US
ship building industry.
I'm sure some of you are wondering why
this is such a big deal. Why can't
suppliers just swap ships, just use a
different ship made in a different
country to reach American
shores? Well, it's not that simple.
China dominates the global ship building
industry. In the month of February, over
1,000 ships were docked on US ports.
10,000 ships. Out of these, 190 were
built in China. That's nearly 20% of all
arrivals in the US. All those ships were
made in China. In fact, more than
onethird of all vessels at
sea were made in Chinese
yards. They produce most of the world
shipping containers. They also dominate
crane production and port
traffic. Now listen to this. Seven out
of the 10 busiest ports on Earth are
Chinese-owned. Seven out of 10. So you
cannot ignore or avoid China ship
industry. They're simply too big and
they're still
expanding. More than half of all ships
under construction as of today are in
Chinese yards and they're still winning
new
orders. Of course, this did not happen
overnight. In the early 2000s, China was
a minor player. After joining the World
Trade Organization, it scaled up fast.
It needed ships to import energy and
export
goods. So, Beijing gave state support to
its
shipyards. It gave subsidies, cheap
loans, affordable steel, and labor
support to ship builders. From 2010 to
2018, Beijing invested $132 billion in
ship building.
Today, Chinese yards are vast and
efficient. They benefit from scale, and
they're nearly impossible to match on
price. The US says this has destroyed
fair competition. American yards are
struggling to compete. So, Trump wants
to fight back by targeting Chinese ships
with
taxes. Experts are
skeptical. Even if the plan succeeds, it
will take time. It takes at least 6 to 7
years for the Americans to launch a new
ship.
That's longer than a single presidential
term. And global trade will not stop
until
then. So Trump is targeting ship
building for the right reasons. He wants
the US to catch up, but his strategy may
take years to deliver. And by then it
may already be too late.
So be sure to look
up. Is there trouble in Pakistan's
paradise? They were dreaming about a
grand reunion with Bangladesh, perhaps
even an alliance against India. But
Dhaka is sending mixed signals. First,
some context. Pakistan's foreign
secretary was in Dhaka yesterday. It was
the first such visit in 15
years. And that tells a story. She Hassa
used to keep Pakistan at bay, but
interim ruler Muhammad Yunus is eyeing a
reset. Hence this trip by the foreign
secretary. She met her Bangladeshi
counterpart yesterday. They discussed a
number of issues including trade and
investment but one issue stood out for
us and that's the 1971 war. Dhaka has
asked Islamabad to apologize for the
genocide. Listen to this.
I raised the historically unresolved
issues with Pakistan such as the
repatriation of stranded Pakistanis,
Bangladesh's rightful share in undivided
assets, the transfer of foreign aid sent
for the victims of the 1970 cyclone, and
a formal apology for the genocide
committed by the then armed forces of
Pakistan in
1971.
Pakistan sounds a bit out of place,
doesn't it? Out of place and out of
syllabus. Dhaka was supposed to reset
ties with Pakistan. Then why are they
seeking an
apology? Well, they could be doing it
for
effect. Anyone can stand up and ask for
an apology. The question is, are you
serious about it? Are you willing to put
pressure on Pakistan and force them to
say sorry? In this case, clearly
not. And I'll tell you why. Pakistan's
foreign secretary also met Ununus Inda
and he was very optimistic. Let me quote
from Dhaka statement. Chief adviser
Eunus put the emphasis on strengthening
ties and boost mutual coop to boost
mutual cooperation and explore trade and
business potentials. He said that
Bangladesh and Pakistan should exchange
more youth and cultural programs to
increase people-to-people
bonding. Basically the apology is
immaterial. Dhaka has not put conditions
on a reset with Pakistan. They're not
saying apologize first. Only then can we
move on. They're resetting ties anyway
and that defeats the point. Pakistan
says all issues from 1971 have been
resolved. In other words, they will not
apologize. That's what they're saying.
Instead of pressuring them, what does
Ununus do? He wants to exchange students
to build a bond. He wants more trade and
investments. It tells you what his
ultimate goal is. Eunus wants a reset
with or without an
apology. What does that mean for India?
Well, the meeting had several red flags
for India. The first being Kashmir.
Pakistan says it briefed Dhaka on the
situation in Kashmir and India will not
like that. New Delhi considers Kashmir
to be a bilateral issue. There is no
room for a third party. Second, the two
sides discussed SARKC. SARKC stands for
South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation. It's like ASEAN for South
Asia. Dhaka and Islamabad are trying to
revive SAR. Pakistan says it must be
insulated from bilateral politics.
Again, India disagrees and for good
reason. New Delhi has accused Pakistan
of hampering
SARKC. Listen to what the Indian foreign
secretary foreign ministry rather said
in February.
Everyone in South Asia is aware of which
country and what activities are
responsible for stying SARKC. Em
conveyed that it is important that
Bangladesh should not normalize
terrorism.
So Dhaka is clearly ganging up with
Pakistan at the same time they're
targeting
India. You may have heard about the
commal clashes in West Bengal this week.
They began over the recently passed wak
bill. Dhaka has waded into those
clashes. Ununice's press secretary is
asking India to protect Indian
Muslims. New Delhi has hit back at
Bangladesh. Let me quote from the
statement. This is a barely disguised
and disingenous attempt to draw a
parallel with India's concerns over the
ongoing persecution of minorities in
Bangladesh where the criminal
perpetrators of such acts continue to
roam free.
It's a fair point.
274 people have been arrested in West
Bengal. Around 60 FIRs, 60 60 FIS have
been
lodged. And that's very different from
Ununice's response. He has tried to
downplay the attacks on Bangladesh's
minority. He said the attacks were
political, not religious, as if that
will magically bring back the dead or
resurrect demolished houses.
If you put all of this together, a clear
picture emerges. Muhammad Yunus is a lot
more comfortable dealing with Pakistan
than India. He prefers Islamabad over
New Delhi. And the bonhomi is not over.
Pakistan's foreign minister will visit
Dhaka later this month. That will give
us more clues about Dhaka's attitude.
But chances are it will be more of the
same.
For our next story, let me ask you a qu
a quick
question. Have you ever just Googled
something once and it starts following
you on the internet like a clingy
X? Like say you Google air fryer recipes
for instance, air fryer recipes. The
next thing you know, all you get are ads
for air fryers. And I know what most of
you are thinking. And no, it's not your
phone listening in. or not just the
phone, it's the world of online
ads. And for the past 10 years, it's
been quietly controlled by one giant
name,
Google. But that control is now under
fire because a US court just called it
what it is, a
monopoly. But will it force Google to
break up its ad business? And what will
it mean for big tech? Our next report
tells you.
All right, picture this. You're browsing
a random recipe blog at night looking
for how to make pancakes. You scroll
past the ingredients list and suddenly
there's an ad for that air fryer you
were googling earlier. Now you have the
power of a full-sized air fryer in the
palm of your hand. Is it creepy? Kind
of. Is it convenient? Definitely.
Allin-one. But how did that ad get
there? That's where things get
interesting because for the last decade,
this ad journey is controlled by just
one company,
Google. In 2023, this got Google mired
into a major antitrust lawsuit. It was
filed by the Department of Justice along
with 17 US states. They argued that
Google dominated the ad marketplace,
that Google stifled competition, and it
was an illegal monopoly.
Google argued that it was only one of
the many companies and the space was
only growing. A US court has now ruled
on it and they say the tech giant indeed
does have a monopoly in online
advertising technology. It says it will
appeal the decision, but does that mean
it will have to break up? Let's
understand the business first. Imagine
the internet is this giant bizaar. On
one side, you've got advertisers, anyone
who is waving cash and wanting your
eyeballs. On the other side, there are
the publishers, news sites, blogs, even
meme pages offering up ad
space. In the middle is the auctioneer.
In this case, that auctioneer has been
Google. But here's the catch. Google
hasn't just been the auctioneer. It owns
the stage and the seats and half the
audience. With tools like Google Ad
Manager and AdX, which is its own ad
exchange, Google became both the
middleman and the decision maker. It was
like running a casino and playing the
tables at the same
time. So, this is how it worked. If you
were a publisher using Google's ad
server, Google's own exchange, AdX, got
first dibs at your ad inventory. So, if
you're a competitor ad exchange, you
never really got a fair shot. Google
tilted the playing field to favor
Google. And then there were the unified
pricing rules. It basically standardized
how ads were priced across exchanges.
That means publishers can't cut deals or
use exchanges to get better rates. They
are stuck with Google dictating the
terms. And this worked in the tech
giant's favor. Let's talk about what we
believe. In 2024 alone, Google rad in
over $200 billion in ad revenue. So,
what happens next? This is the second
antitrust case Google has lost in a
year. In August last year, a court ruled
that the company also had a monopoly on
online search. The courts haven't
ordered remedies yet. But the question
is whether Google could be forced to
spin off parts of its ad business, like
actually separate AdX from its ad
server. If that happens, we're talking
about a major shakeup in how ads work
online, maybe even giving smaller
companies a shot at competing
again. But tech giant breakups are rare
and hard to come by. And this antirust
ruling isn't just about Google.
Metatu is facing a similar antitrust
ruling over its purchase of Instagram
and WhatsApp. The US antitrust watchdog
accuses it of acquiring competition to
kill them. So this judgment is about all
of Silicon Valley. Because in the fight
for the internet's future, the question
isn't just who runs the show, it's
whether anyone else ever gets a chance
to.
Our next story is about China. the
troublemakers who call themselves
peacemakers. China has been caught
red-handed. It is fueling conflict in
two regions, in the Red Sea and in
Ukraine. Let's begin with the Red Sea.
You know about the Houthis, the rebel
group in Yemen. They have turned the Red
Sea hot. Missile and drone attacks are a
daily affair. They target all kinds of
ships, even American warships. And the
attacks only seem to be increasing
because the Houthis have shifted
strategy. They have gone from blind
launches to GPS-based attacks. That's
right. The Houthis are using satellite
imagery to target
ships. How does a ragtag group of rebels
get such
technology? Thanks to China. Beijing is
giving Houthi's geospatial intelligence
says who? The US State Department.
Listen to this. We can confirm the
reporting that Chang Guang Satellite
Technology Company Limited is directly
supporting Iranbacked Houthi terrorist
attacks on US interests. Their actions
and Beijing's support of the company
even after our private engagements with
them is yet another example of China's
empty claims to support peace.
The US has named a Chinese firm, the
Chang Guang satellite
technology. This firm has ties to the
Chinese army and it is providing Houthis
with realtime intelligence like the
speed and direction of ships, even heat
signatures. So ships can be located at
night and in bad weather. And this kind
of data is mostly used by militaries.
But China is giving it to the Houthis.
And that explains the increasing attacks
on US warships.
Here's what the State Department is
saying. The Chinese company sends pings
to the Houthis. This happens every time
a US warship is nearby and it includes
two things. A live bird's eye view of
the warship and the route that it is
taking. This gives the Houthis all the
intelligence they need and they're using
it to their advantage by launching
weapons and incre with increased
accuracy forcing American warships to
become
defensive. But what does China gain
here? Strategic
disruption. Let me explain. The Red Sea
is vital for Western nations. 40% of
their trade passes through here. Attacks
on ships mean two things. First, rising
premiums on to ensure the vessels. The
insurance rises. And second, delays in
shipments. You have to take another
route. In short, the Houthi strike, the
West pays, and China smiles.
So that's what China is up to in the Red
Sea. Now let's tell you about the other
war zone, the war in
Ukraine. What's China doing there?
Apparently arming Russia. This is
according to the Ukrainian president. He
says he has proof that China is
supplying weapons to Russia.
I think it's important information. It's
not very pleasant. We finally received
information that China is supplying
weapons to the Russian Federation and we
are ready to talk about it in detail.
Today we have general information from
the security service from intelligence
about gunpowder artillery.
So China is giving Russia gunpowder and
artillery. That's what Zilinski says.
And that's not all. He says Chinese
nationals are building weapons on
Russian soil.
And I think we will be able to talk
about it in great detail next week,
especially about the data that we
believe shows that Chinese
representatives are engaged in the
production of some weapons on the
territory of Russia.
Now, these are some serious allegations.
Zilinski says he has proof. He plans to
reveal it next week. China has dismissed
the claims. It says it is neutral and
committed to peace.
It's the old China playbook, deny and
deflect. But it won't be so easy. Last
week, Chinese nationals were captured by
Ukraine. They were fighting on behalf of
Russia. We don't know if there are their
volunteers or recruits. Ukraine claims
that there are more Chinese and Russian
ranks, but China's support goes beyond
this. It also sells Russia dual use
goods, things that can be used for both
civilian and military purposes, hence
the name dual use. We're talking about
stuff like your drone parts or
microchips. China sells these to Russia
in large numbers. The trade is worth
$300 million every
month. Basically, China is giving Russia
critical military components and Russia
often uses these Chinese parts in its
weapons.
So what is the big picture? China's mask
is off. Its fingerprints are all over
the two war zones. The Red Sea and and
Ukraine are not isolated conflicts. You
see, these are strategic battlegrounds.
And China is playing the game using
proxies. It is fighting not with bullets
or bombs, but with chips and signals
from the
sky. Our next story is from Scotland. A
motion was tabled in the Scottish
Parliament. a motion to recognize and
tackle Hindu
phobia. This is a first of its kind in
all of Europe. It calls for education
and dialogue and understanding Hinduism
better because Hindus are increasingly
being targeted. Just look at the UK.
Temples have been vandalized here.
Hindus often face slurs, systemic bias,
and are even being called
extremists. But Hindophobia is not
unique to the UK. Hindus have been
targeted in several western countries
like Canada and the US and that is why
what Scotland is doing
matters. But will they walk the talk and
will others follow? Our next report
brings you
more. A historic motion was stabled in
the Scottish Parliament this week. One
that aims to recognize and tackle Hindu
phobia. It was tabled by Ash Reagan, a
parliamentarian from the Alba party.
Reagan raised concerns about the rise in
targeting of Hindus in Scotland. She
said the motion will address the
barriers faced by the Hindu community
and also called for more dialogue and a
better understanding of
Hinduism. Here's why this is
significant. It is the first of its kind
motion not just in Scotland but all of
Europe. The motion was inspired by a
report titled Hindophobia in Scotland
which was published by the Gandhian
Peace Society. This report was presented
to the Scottish Parliament in January
this year and it has some shocking data
on Hindus being targeted in Scotland.
It highlights instances of Hindu temples
being vandalized, homes of Hindus being
attacked with stones and bricks and
Hindus facing discrimination when
applying for jobs, including for
government
positions. And this is just in Scotland
where the Hindu community is 16,000 in
number. The truth is that Hindophobia
has been on the rise in several western
nations. Let's zoom out from Scotland.
Hate crimes against Hindus have
increased in recent times in the United
Kingdom. Hindu temples have been
attacked. Hindus have been subject to
deriggatory remarks. Even Britain's
first Hindu prime minister Rishi Sunnak
was not spared. In Canada and Australia,
Hindu temples have been vandalized by
extremists. Hindus have also reported
prejudice and discrimination at
workplaces in both these
countries. In the United States, Hindus
face harassment routinely. This has been
seen at political rallies and in
educational
institutions. In March, a Hindu temple
was also vandalized in California,
reigniting the debate about Hindu phobia
in the
US. The rise in hate crimes against
Hindus and anti-Hindu bias is
concerning. That's why Scotland's motion
is a welcome step and voices against
Hindu phobia are only growing.
In the US, the Hindu community is
pushing for justice. They are demanding
an end to Hindu phobia. Georgia has now
become the first state in the US to
introduce a bill that formally
recognizes Hindu phobia. The bill seeks
to introduce a new section in the state
government's code that defines Hindu
phobia. It would require state law
enforcement to address instances of
Hindu phobia as cases of discrimination.
Western nations are slowly waking up to
this reality. They are now seeing the
discrimination against Hindus and are
calling for stronger hate crime laws.
But for now, these are only motions and
bills. No concrete policies or laws have
been passed. Scotland's move is a
positive step in the right direction.
It's now time for the world to catch up.
A decade ago in Vienna, the US and Iran
shook hands. They signed what was called
the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action. The world knew it as the Iran
Nuclear Deal. It did not last. Donald
Trump became president. He walked away
from the deal. What followed was
accusations, backlash, and threats. And
then there was silence for years.
Now in 2025, against all odds, the deal
is back on the table, not as a symbol of
hope, but as a tired necessity. The
first round of talks was held in Oman.
Not much came out of it, but the red
lines became clear. For the US, it's all
about a nuke. Iran cannot have a nuclear
weapon. So verification is a key ask
from the American side. How much uranium
is Iran enriching and how closely can
they watch? Iran can't have a nuclear
weapon. It's, you know, pretty simple.
It's really simple. We're not looking to
take their industry. We're not looking
to take their land. We're not all we're
saying is we you can't have a nuclear
weapon.
But the Iran, it's about sovereignity.
Their right to en enrich uranium is
non-negotiable. Iran will not compromise
on that.
What is certain is that Iran's
enrichment program is a real accepted
matter. We are prepared to build trust
and address any potential concerns, but
the core issue of enrichment itself is
not negotiable.
So, two sides, two red lines, and now
they're heading into round two. The
talks will take place this weekend.
There was some confusion over the
location. Iranian officials said it
would be Oman again. American officials
remained quiet. Reports suggested it
would be Italy. All of that has been
cleared now. Both sides will meet in
Rome for round two. And who is leading
the talks? On the US side, it is Steve
Witkov, Trump's golf buddy and the US
envoy to envoy to West Asia. On the
Iranian side, it is Abbas Araji, Iran's
foreign minister and a career diplomat.
Oman will be mediating these talks and
there are some other players involved
too like Russia and Saudi Arabia. Thran
has asked Russia for help and Moscow
says it is ready to play any role in the
talks. over. We are ready to help
mediate and play any role that from
Iran's point of view will be useful and
that will be acceptable to the United
States. We proceed from the fact that
the only option for an agreement, as the
minister just said, is an agreement
exclusively on nuclear issues.
Meanwhile, the Saudi defense minister is
in Thran. He met with Iranian officials
just before the second round of talks.
The two sides did not mention the
nuclear deal explicitly. But it's an
issue that impacts the entire region.
The biggest impact will be on Israel.
Look at this latest report. It says
Israel wanted to attack Iranian nuclear
facilities next month. Everything was
finalized. They were just waiting for an
okay from Washington, but Donald Trump
killed the plan. Why? Because the US
president wanted to pursue the nuclear
deal. Benim and Netanyahu even tried to
talk to Trump about this. The Israeli
prime minister called him on the 3rd of
April. Trump invited him to the White
House. 4 days later, Netanyahu was in
the oval office and that's when Trump
dropped the bomb. He told the Israeli
leader about the direct talks with Iran.
We're having direct talks with Iran and
uh they've started. It'll go on
Saturday. We have a very big meeting and
we'll see what can happen. And I think
everybody agrees that uh doing a deal
would be
preferable to doing the obvious. and the
obvious is not something that I want to
be involved with or frankly that Israel
wants to be involved with if they can
avoid it. So, we're going to see
if the talks are centered around a
three-stage deal. Stage one, Iran scales
back uranium uranium enrichment to
3.67% which is the limit they set in the
2015 nuclear deal. In return, Iran gets
access to billions in frozen assets.
Also, a green light to export limited
volumes of oil. Again, that's stage one.
Stage two, America eases more sanctions.
Iran allows full access to IAA
inspectors. Stage three, Iran ships out
its stockpile of enriched uranium to a
neutral third country. In return, the US
formally ratifies the deal, meaning they
pass it through their Congress. And this
will prevent future US presidents from
tearing it up again if the US Congress
has passed
it. So, Iran does not get a nuclear
weapon. The US ease sanctions and
everyone is happy. Or are they? What
will a deal mean for West Asia? For
Iran, this is a lifeline. Of course, its
axis of resistance is in a shambles. Its
economy is teetering. Millions of
Iranians are hoping for economic relief.
So this deal gives them an out for the
Gulf states too. It is some relief. They
want to avoid a regional war, another
one. But they're also watching it with
unease. A US Iran repro could could go
either way. It could either bring
stability or it could completely reshape
regional
alliances. Then there is the oil market.
If sanctions are eased, Iran could start
exporting oil again. Before 2018, their
capacity was 3.8 million barrels per
day. That's how much oil Iran exported.
3.8 million barrels per day. And that
will be a major jump in global supply if
they resume this. It's nearly 2% of the
global demand. So this will dramatically
bring down oil
prices. But not everyone is so
optimistic, especially Iran Supreme
Leader Ayat. He says a deal may not be
reached.
The first steps have been taken well and
executed properly. From here on, the
process should be followed carefully.
The red lines are clear both for the
other side and for us. We may or may not
reach a result, but either way, it's
worth pursuing.
So, what happens next? A deal could
either diffuse a crisis or light the
fuse. All eyes are on Rome.
Did you know that when students study
languages like Italian or
Finnish, they have 90% reading accuracy
within the first
year? But that is not the case with
English. Students take almost double the
time learning English. And experts say
that this is mostly thanks to its
spellings.
English has 26 letters, but more than 44
individual sounds. A single letter can
make many different
sounds. Similarly spelled words often do
not
rhyme. Plus, there are sneak attacks by
the silent letters. English is not
phonetic. Its spellings are not
standardized.
So, why is the English spelling system
unnecessarily hard? And has anyone tried
to simplify it? Our next report tells
you, what if you could create the most
complicated spelling system in the
world? What would be your mode of
torture? Silent letters, vowel
alterations? Would you like Latin or
Norse roots? Maybe some Greek suffixes.
Well, whatever you pick, you may not be
able to do worse than English because
the English spelling has all of this and
more. English started as a Germanic
language. It took off with the invasion
of Britain during the fifth century. But
as people sought new lands, the language
spread its wings, and today it haunts
about 1.5 billion people the world over
who stumbled and fumbled through the
language. Download anymore. Don't
believe us? Say soup, southern sound.
The same u spelling but different
pronunciations. But say to shoe, flu,
glue, they're different spellings with
the same oo
pronunciation. Meanwhile, air and bear
rhyme, but laughter and daughter don't.
The c in city sounds like an s, but the
c in cat sounds like a k. And honestly,
what's going on with the silent letters?
We doubt you think they're easy to
grasp. Research shows that when students
study European languages like French or
Italian, they usually grasp them well
within the first year. But the rate of
development in English is more than
twice as slow. According to another
study, dyslexic English speakers suffer
disproportionately compared with
speakers of other languages.
But we don't need studies to know that
the English spelling is irregular. In
fact, as long as English has been
written down, its complexity has
bothered people. Among them was Benjamin
Franklin. In
1768, he proposed removing six letters
from the alphabet, C, J, Q, W, X, and Y.
And he tried to simplify the spelling.
Then came the dictionary pioneer Noah
Webster. Long before he became a
household name, he launched a rather
loud assault against silent letters. In
1789, he wrote D A W T E R should
replace daughter. His idea didn't take
off completely, but it did help make US
spellings slightly shorter and more
phonetic, at least compared to their UK
variants. The peak of this movement came
in the early 1900s.
US President Theodore Roosevelt issued
an executive order saying that all
public federal documents must be written
in simplified and phonetic spelling. But
the backlash was intense with papers
calling him
Roosevelt. But since then the
simplification of the English spelling
has been seen as a fringe movement. But
knowingly or unknowingly that may be
changing now. We are writing shorter,
simpler spellings, partly thanks to the
internet with Google returning more
results for US spellings globally. And
of course, there's a Reddit page hating
on it. But this Googleization, wait, we
mean globalization, is one of the
biggest reasons why non-native speakers
like Thai learners prefer the shorter
American spellings. The second big
reason behind the simplification of
English spellings is, yes, you guessed
it, Gen Z. They are changing the
language one keystroke and one reel at a
time. So the English spelling is going
through some turbulent times, but it'll
be a while before it's sacrificed at the
altar of standardization. Until then,
you can depend on your trustworthy
autocorrect and hope that you don't end
up like the White House press that urged
for lasting peach in West Asia.
Today is the World Heritage Day. It is
celebrated every year on April 18th to
honor and protect cultural and natural
heritage the world over. Why are we
telling you about this? Because on on
the occasion of World Heritage Day,
India has yet another reason to
celebrate. UNESCO has honored two
ancient Indian
manuscripts. UNESCO stands for the
United Nations Educational Scientific
and Cultural Organization. It maintains
what is called a memory of the world
register. Think of it as an
international register. It recognizes
heritage collections of global repute.
So far it has
570 inscribed collections. 570
collections from 72
countries and four international
organizations. Many Indian inscriptions
are on this list like the Ramcharitam
Manis by Tulsias. It is considered one
of the greatest works of Hindu
literature and
punchantra. This ancient Indian
manuscript is a is a compilation of
animal fables. Many such texts have made
it to UNESCO's memory register. And now
the total stands at 14 with two editions
this year. The Bhagat Gita and the Nat
Shastra. You have most probably read the
Gita or heard about it at the very
least. It was written by Vyas. It is
part of the epic Mahabharat. It is dated
to the 2nd or 1st BCE but it is
considered a timeless philosophical
guide. It remains relevant even
today and it has been translated into
about 80
languages. Let's also tell you about the
Nat Shastra. It is one of the most
notable and comprehensive documents on
performing arts anywhere in the world.
You'd be surprised to know that even the
conventions of Bollywood are rooted in
this ancient text.
It was written in the 2nd century BCE in
the Sanskrit language by Bharat
Puni. The Nati Shastra has 6,000 verses
which explore all elements of theater,
dance, music, aesthetics, costumes, all
of it. It was written to make drama as a
culture accessible to all levels of
society. But in today's
world, it no longer enjoys the same
understanding or relevance that it once
used to. And this is not just limited to
one manuscript. India is the land of
many cultures. It has one of the oldest
civilizations in the world. Experts say
that ever since the Vic age, which began
around 1500 B.C.E., India has made
efforts to excel as a knowledge
society and manuscripts revolutionize
discourse.
India has an incredible treasure trove
of them. We have more than 5 million
ancient
manuscripts among the largest sets in
the world. This repository includes
scripts on palm leaves and paper. It
includes texts, commentaries, manuals,
literature and it is an aesthetic
colorful
folio with calligraphy, illustrations
and historic royal seals.
And with India's inclusion in the memory
box, it is a matter of great pride that
the world is recognizing this rich
heritage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi
has hailed this. He says that it is a
proud moment for every Indian across the
world. He's right. It is indeed a proud
moment, but it's also a moment to
reflect. So many of us have all but
forgotten about our ancient texts. We've
let more than 200 languages die over the
past six decades.
And this is not just about our written
heritage. We feel great when Indian
sites get global attention. 43 of them
are on the UNESCO's world heritage
list. And we know the big names like the
Taj Mahel or the Ajanta caves. But did
you know that India has about 3,700
declared archaeological
sites? India's heritage is not one
thing. It is built off stones and
scripts. It is found in temple walls and
ancient carvings in the joy of folk
dance and regional
delicacies. It is a testament to India's
storied past. It has stood the test of
time and it is our duty to keep it
alive. By now it's amply clear that
economics is not Donald Trump's strong
suit. But we can also tell you that
geography certainly
isn't. Yesterday he was speaking to
Italy's Prime Minister George Maloney
about illegal immigration, about how
people come to America from all over the
world, even from a place called
Congo. You may know that Congo is a
country in Africa. In fact, there are
two Congo, the Republic of Congo and the
Democratic Republic of Congo,
DRC. But President Trump says he doesn't
know what a Congo is.
It's not the first time he's messed up
countries either. Take a look at this.
Many, many people come from the Congo. I
don't know what that is, but they came
from the Congo and all over the world.
They came
in. So,
Belgium is a beautiful
city and I'm greatly honored to host
this lunch to be joined by the leaders
of
Kotavoir, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea,
Nambia, Nambia.
This is an

Finally, we are taking you back in
history on this day in 1980. Zimbabwe
gained independence from the UK after 90
years of colonial rule. The country was
briefly ruled by a white minority in the
1960s and '7s, but a civil war ended in
complete
independence. Leaving you with that.
Thanks very much for watching. Have a
great weekend.
happiness.
Congratulations.
So help me God.
Come
on.
Yeah.
Too late.
Goodbye.
Hello and a warm good Friday to everyone
and welcome to First Post America. I'm
Eric Ham coming to you live from the
nation's capital in Washington DC. And
over the next few minutes, we'll take
you from the United States and around
the world covering all the top stories
of the day. But before that, here's a
look at the latest headlines.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio warns the
United States will abandon its efforts
within days and move on if no progress.
