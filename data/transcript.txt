hello and welcome to Vantage this week a
show where we recap the highlights of
the week gone by donald Trump has paused
the tariffs for now but he is escalating
the trade war with China he's confident
that Beijing will make a deal but China
has responded with reciprocal tariffs
how are global markets reacting we'll
discuss all of that in Afghanistan the
US is looking to make a comeback an
American military plane landed in the
Bram air base this week it offloaded
military equipment and intelligence
officials is Trump serious about
retaking Bram from the
Taliban and an American startup claims
to have resurrected an extinct species
the dire wolf that had died almost
12,500 years ago all this and more lined
up let's get started
[Music]
investors cannot catch a break us
President Donald Trump's relentless
assault on global stock markets
continues stocks across the board
crashed again today and it was worse
than last week it is being called a
black Monday panic has swept through the
markets from Mumbai to Tokyo in India
the Sensex crashed over 2200 points and
the Nifty fell by over 3% below the
22,200
mark in one day investors have lost over
13 lakh cr rupees in India that's around
150 billion this money has vanished from
the Bombay stock exchange alone needless
to say the sell-off was brutal every
sector was in the in the red deep in the
red it's the same story across Asia
tokyo's Nikai dropped by over
8% taiwan's TX fell by almost 10% in
both markets the circuit breaker was
triggered what is the circuit breaker if
the stock prices rally or fall way too
quickly the markets hit a pause button
this gives a moment to all investors to
calm down and think before making any
decisions today markets in Japan and
Taiwan hit the bottom circuit meaning
they crashed hard and they crashed way
too fast so trading had to be suspended
to stop further panic selling in Hong
Kong things were equally bad their stock
market is called the Hang Sen it
suffered its steepest decline since 1997
we're talking about a slump of
13% it was so bad that China's sovereign
wealth fund had to intervene they bought
shares to stabilize the market the
picture looks quite scary there is panic
and fear it has all been triggered by
Donald Trump by his sweeping tariffs on
US trade partners over the weekend Trump
doubled down on his plan china what's
going to happen with the market i can't
tell you but I can tell you our country
has gotten a lot stronger and
eventually it'll be a country like no
other it'll be the most dominant country
economically in the world
trump's tariffs have hit everyone
America's allies and adversaries but it
is Asia that is suffering the most it
seems and that's because Asia is a major
manufacturing hub its economy depends on
exports to the US trump has placed some
of the highest tariffs on this region
just look at the rates japan and South
Korea face
26% duties india again 26% thailand
36% vietnam 46% Cambodia 49% and China a
whopping 54% tariffs so clearly Asia is
bearing the brunt its economies are
under intense pressure but Americans
will feel the pain too us investors are
sounding an alarm a recession looks
increasingly
likely america's top banks are giving
ominous predictions the latest one to do
so is Goldman Sachs it says there's a
45% chance of a recession last week JP
Morgan had revised its forecast it
raised the the possibility of a
recession to
60% and both these banks have blamed the
Trump tariffs for this state of affairs
they've termed it a risk to the US
economy
of course the US president disagrees he
calls the tariffs a medicine a medicine
which the US economy must take his
Treasury Secretary has also defended the
tariffs
mr secretary how difficult is it going
to be and how long are Americans going
to have to hang tough well again I
reject that assumption there doesn't
have to be a recession who knows how the
market is going to react in a day in a
week what we're looking at is building
the long-term economic fundamentals for
prosperity that I think the previous
administration had put us on the course
toward financial calamity
but investors are starting to push back
one of them is Bill Aman the billionaire
hedge fund manager this is a man who had
backed Donald Trump he agreed that
global trade needs to be rebalanced but
now he feels that Trump has gone too far
he is calling for a 90-day pause on the
tariff
plan or a timeout as he called it aman
believes US trade partners should use
this window they should negotiate deals
with the Trump administration otherwise
the fallout could be
severe in fact let me quote Aman if on
the other hand on April 9th we launch
economic nuclear war on every country in
the world business investment will grind
to a halt consumers will close their
wallets and pocketbooks and we will
severely damage our reputation with the
rest of the world that will take years
and potentially decades to rehabilitate
jamie Diamond has echoed Bill Aman's
concerns jaie Diamond is the chairman of
JP Morgan Chase it is America's biggest
bank diamond says the tariffs would and
I'm quoting again push up prices for
Americans so basically Wall Street is
calling for restraint only a climb down
by President Trump would calm the
markets the question is will he consider
it reports say Trump could be mulling a
90-day pause in these tariffs all
countries except China could get this
temporary reprieve a 90-day pause
basically Trump would delay the tariffs
that's what the report said the markets
heaved a sigh of relief but then the
White House issued a statement calling
these reports fake news and on Q the
markets fell
again we're talking about the US markets
they opened just a few hours back and
they remain volatile in fact since
Trump's tariff announcement US stocks
have lost over $6 trillion in market
value the Trump presidency is not
working out for Wall Street at all since
inauguration day in January since Donald
Trump's inauguration as president us
stocks have lost a record 11 trillion in
value 11 trillion europe 2 is mirroring
Asia's losses germany's DAX France's CAC
and UK's Footsie 100 all of them fell by
over 5%
today you see markets need a semblance
of certainty and
continuity but this is a shakeup of
seismic
proportions no wonder there's hysteria
and it's far from over if Donald Trump
stays the course the worst may be yet to
come
[Music]
is there pain in the market at some
point you're unwilling to tolerate the I
I think your question is so stupid i
mean I think it's a I don't want
anything to go down but sometimes you
have to take medicine to fix something
[Applause]
i want more people to show up and uh get
him out of office he's
[Music]
terrible donald Trump announced the
tariffs last week the world first
blinked then it panicked then markets
crashed and then trillions were wiped
off just today the S&P 500 added and
erased $2.5 trillion in one hour all on
the basis of what was later called a
fake news headline $2.5
trillion but the US president does not
seem to care he does not think it's a
it's a bad thing in fact Trump believes
that this is exactly what America needs
a bitter pill is there pain in the
market at some point you're unwilling to
tolerate i I think your question is so
stupid i mean I think it's a I don't
want anything to go down but sometimes
you have to take medicine to fix
something
which has led many to ask the question
did Trump do it on purpose did he want
the markets to crash i know it's a weird
question to ask
but there's no smoke without fire and
the fire was lit by the president
himself on Friday he reposted a video
link on his social media platform Truth
Social the video is by a Tik Tok user
and this is what he's suggesting secret
game he's playing trump is crashing the
market on purpose trump is crashing the
stock market by 20% this month but he's
doing it on purpose and this is why
Warren Buffett just said Trump is making
the best economic moves he's seen in
over 50 years now here's the secret game
he's playing and it could make you
rich so how does this even work the
video claims that this is like a wild
chess move trump imposes the tariffs the
market crashes he forces money into US
Treasury bonds the Fed cuts interest
rates lower rates mean lower mortgage
payments the dollar becomes weaker
companies end up making more in America
so grocery prices tumble and somehow the
middle class is
saved it sounds convoluted it also
sounds like a classic conspiracy theory
because it most probably is the funny
part is that Trump seems to be backing
it in fact this has been his position
and calculation throughout
look at his latest post on Truth Social
trump says and I'm quoting "Oil prices
are down interest rates are down food
prices are down and there is no
inflation." And the longtime abused USA
is bringing in billions of dollars a
week from the abusing countries on
tariffs that are already in
place so Trump clearly believes that
tariffs are a good thing that this is
America's bitter pill but is the bitter
pill too bitter americans certainly
think so they have been protesting in
all 50 states thousands of Americans
took to the streets over the weekend
they had just two words for their
president hands off
i think it's important to speak up i
think silence is not an option i think
you have to stay engaged you have to
stay vigilant i think is is not only for
our community at large but the world at
large i think that enough is enough we
object to the uh everything that uh
Donald Trump is doing basically in terms
of his power grab and all the damage
he's doing to the economy and to
democracy that's why I'm I'm saying the
Trump slump is
basically the the stock market's
crashing the economy is going to crash
it's already crashing and it's it's all
about Trump it's all his his actions his
stupidity his
uh mistakes
the protest stretched from New York to
Los Angeles around 600,000 people signed
up organizers claimed the number was
more than a million either way anger is
clearly in the air not just at rallies
or on the streets but also in quieter
battlegrounds like grocery lines in less
than two weeks America will celebrate
Easter but this year the Easter bunnies
got budget issues because Americans
cannot even afford eggs back in February
prices cracked a record $8 for a dozen
eggs prices have dipped a little since
but they are still not exactly sunny
side up and eggs are not just for
breakfast they are an Easter tradition
so Americans are turning to the next
best thing dyed potatoes for instance
because they're cheap others are
stuffing plastic cases some are also
eyeing golf
balls basically anything cheaper and
round that can be passed off as eggs and
this is just one example americans are
rushing to stock up on things on
groceries on apparel even on furniture
some in fact are buying cars too all
before tariffs cause a massive price
hike but will any of this force Trump to
rethink his policy it looks unlikely at
the moment trump is still selling his
tariffs as some kind of miracle
cure the markets are swallowing that
medicine and they're showing serious
side effects like panic plummeting
portfolios and economic
indigestion but even Trump must know
that playing Jenga with the economy is a
risky game so this is where America is
at the moment caught between a president
prescribing economic shock therapy and a
public tired of being the guinea pig
donald Trump calls his plan visionary
his critics call it volatile because for
team Trump it may be a highstakes
experiment in power but for millions of
Americans it's a battle for survival
i thought that people were uh jumping a
little bit out of line they were getting
yippy you know they were getting a
little bit
yippy bond market is very tricky i was
watching it but if you look at it now
it's
[Music]
beautiful china wants to make a deal
they just don't know how quite to go
about
[Music]
it so the tariffs kicked in yesterday
morning and by nightfall Trump had hit
pause a 90-day pause for every country
except China no details no real
explanation just a pause so what changed
for a president whose brand is rooted in
toughness this is a rare concession
trump's been hyping up this tariff plan
for weeks promising to go full steam
ahead there was no backing down not even
when the markets tanked so what prompted
the sudden U-turn well I thought that
people were uh jumping a little bit out
of line they were getting yippy you know
they were getting a little bit yippy a
little bit afraid unlike these champions
because we have a big job to do no other
president would have done what I did no
other pre I know the presidents they
wouldn't have done it and it had to be
done
you heard him trump says people were
getting yippy that's the word he used
yippi but chances are this was not the
only reason so let's look at the factors
that led to this U-turn number one US
debt
bonds the trade war hit them hard it
triggered a panic sell-off of US bonds
and what are bonds you see governments
need money to run a country but they
don't always have enough of that money
so they borrow money by selling
something that is called
bonds and who buys these bonds
individuals companies even foreign
governments they can all buy US
government bonds or any government bonds
for that matter in return the government
pays them interest that's the long and
short of a government bond now US
government bonds are usually seen as a
good investment people love buying US
bonds because they're seen as a safe
haven investors flocked to them during
tough
times so the bond market is like a
canary in a coal mine but this time
something spooked the canary trump's
tariffs kicked off a trade war it made
investors nervous so many of them
started selling their US
bonds when you sell bond prices drop and
what happens when bond prices drop
interest rates go up basically it costs
the government more to borrow money
there aren't enough people buying their
bonds and that signals just one thing
investors were losing confidence in the
US
economy so Donald Trump was not really
worried about the markets collapsing but
the bond selloff that was a different
story altogether if it kept going his
entire agenda could have become
financially untenable
so behind the scenes Trump officials
were panicking his own Treasury
Secretary by the way called the
situation and I'm quoting
uncomfortable looks like it got a little
too uncomfortable
bond market is very tricky i was
watching it but if you look at it now
it's uh it's beautiful the bond market
right now is beautiful uh but yeah I saw
last night where people were getting a
little queasy i think everything had uh
well the big move wasn't what I did
today the big move was what I did on
liberation day
so that was reason number one the bond
market selloff that threatened the
financial stability of the US government
reason number two Trump was losing
political capital while markets were
sending signals Trump's phone lines were
melting ceos were frantically dialing
the White House republicans were seeking
clarity constituents were asking for
answers and all of them had the same
warning their patience had
limits with midterm elections next year
and public sentiment souring the cost of
staying the course was rising by the
hour you have to have
flexibility uh I could say "Here's a
wall and I'm going to go through that
wall i'm going to go through it no
matter what and keep going." And you
can't go through the wall sometimes you
have to be able to go under the wall
around the wall or over the wall these
guys know that better than anybody right
which brings us to reason number three
negotiations ironically it was the
success of the tariff threat that gave
Trump an
offramp the tariffs jolted countries
into picking up the phone they all
wanted to talk to Trump in true art of
the deal fashion that's the whole point
make a big move rattle the room then
wait for them to come to you in Trumpian
logic that looks like a victory so for
him this is not a pause this is a
tactical recalibration a pause that
could give way to 100 potential trade
deals a deal is going to be made with
China a deal's going to be made with
every one of them and they'll be fair
deals i just want fair uh they will be
fair deals for
everybody but they weren't fair to the
United States they were sucking us dry
this tells you all you need to know
about Donald Trump he's a man of gut
decisions calibrated more by cable news
than cabinet meetings policy is often
reactive not proactive negotiation is a
performance not a process one week the
world braces for a trade war the next
it's a pause and a negotiation bonanza
so what happens next will the tariffs
come back after 90 days maybe maybe not
no one knows for
sure but what happened here says
something bigger trade wars are not just
about tariffs they're also about timing
perception and politics and sometimes
even the boldest of plans have to
wait let's talk about China now donald
Trump is doubling down on Beijing in two
days he has raised tariffs on China
twice the tax on Chinese imports is now
at 125%
that's higher than anyone else anything
coming from China into the US will be
taxed 125% the US president has singled
out
China there is no tariff pause for the
Chinese at the same time he believes
that China wants to make a deal with him
china wants to make a deal they just
don't know how quite to go about it you
know it's one of those things they don't
know quite they're proud people and uh
President Xi's a proud man i know him
very well and they don't know quite how
to go about it but they'll figure it out
they're in the process of figuring it
out but they want to make a deal so
Trump has not given up hope he believes
China does want to make a deal but Xi
Jinping doesn't know how to ask that may
or may not be the case what we can say
is this xi Jinping has a response and he
is delivering it quite clearly and
effectively china is retaliating every
step of the way
in round one Trump slabed a 54% tariff
on China china hit back with 84%
retaliatory tariffs on US
imports enraged Donald Trump raised the
stakes he increased the tariffs on China
to
125% but Beijing remains undeterred it
is fighting back in multiple ways some
symbolic others substantial for instance
China has moved the WTO against the US
that's the World Trade Organization its
mandate is to enforce international
trade rules but in recent years its
limitations have become quite
obvious so China's appeal may be just to
make a point the WTO may not be able to
help them very
much the second move from Beijing is
this it is punishing American businesses
it has restricted 18 US companies they
will have a tough time doing business in
China now and this happened yesterday 18
companies today Beijing went after
Hollywood reports say it will curb movie
imports from the
US and now with Donald Trump raising the
stakes further China plans to target
American interests in more ways here's
what they said today
the United States is still imposing
tariffs on China and China is firmly
opposed to such bullying china will
absolutely not accept pressure threats
and blackmail that is not the right way
to deal with China if the US side really
wants to talk it should show an attitude
of equality respect and reciprocity if
the United States ignores the interest
of the two countries and the
international community and insists on
fighting a tariff war and a trade war
China will certainly accompany it to the
end we will fight till the end they're
calling Trump's actions
blackmail what about Trump's offers to
make a deal does Beijing want to work
something out here's what China's
commerce ministry here's how they
responded to the question
china's position is clear and consistent
the door to talks is open but dialogue
must be conducted on an equal basis with
mutual respect china will stand by its
position until the end pressuring
threatening and blackmailing are not the
correct ways to deal with China we hope
that the US will work with China based
on the principles of mutual respect
peaceful coexistence and a win-win
cooperation we will properly resolve
differences through dialogue and
consultation thank you
china says it is open to dialogue but it
doesn't trust the US it doesn't believe
that Trump will negotiate in good faith
it's a bit rich coming from China but I
guess that's how karma works
unfortunately this deadlock hurts the
rest of the world too because the US and
China are the world's two biggest
economies their clash will have a lot of
collateral damage the US is the biggest
importer of goods in the world china is
the biggest exporter unlike other
countries Trump has not given China an
out neither has Beijing shown any sign
of stepping back it is preparing for the
long haul complete with a trade war
toolkit china is basically working on
two fronts one stabilizing its economy
two raising pressure on the US at home
Beijing is working to calm the stock
markets and for this it has mobilized
state-owned enterprises S Oees they're
very big in China when Chinese stocks
fell after Trump's announcement these
state-owned enterprises bought shares to
keep prices
stable china's Reserve Bank is also
doing its bit it has allowed their
currency the yuan to weaken and how does
that help it makes Chinese exports
cheaper it negates the impact of the
tariffs to a certain extent beijing is
also trying to control the narrative
chinese sensors have been selectively of
course censoring posts online about
Trump's tariffs and the larger trade war
posts that target and criticize the US
are being allowed the ones that discuss
Trump's tariffs in details are being
removed the idea is to shape public
sentiment in favor of China and paint
the US in poor light so that's the
domestic response and in the days ahead
China could take more targeted steps it
could hit US agricultural imports that's
a key part of Trump's support base the
US financial services sector could also
be in the crosshairs this includes
American investment banks and asset
management companies again these are
part of Trump's support base so the aim
is to strike at Trump's political
backers to build pressure on the US
president these do not look like the
moves of a country that is dying to get
a deal with
Trump this is a fight back the US China
trade war is escalating
[Music]
so two of the world's biggest economies
are locking horns the United States and
China they are in a trade war and it is
getting uglier by the day each day
brings a new tariff this is no longer
about policy this has become a contest
with each side trying to outdo the other
yesterday the US raised tariffs on China
again the new rate is
145% 145% tariffs on Chinese goods
coming into the
US and today China hit back they will
tax all US imports at 125% now at the
same time Beijing has drawn a line it
said that this would be their final move
no more tariff hikes from China after
this one because frankly the numbers
don't matter anymore they have stopped
making sense china says the current
tariffs are already too high at these
levels trade between the US and China no
longer makes sense so if Trump raises
tariffs again Beijing says it will not
respond at least not on the tariff front
the Chinese Commerce Ministry issued a
statement it said these number and this
numbers game and I'm quoting has become
a
joke and China's foreign ministry went
further to say
this
our countermeasures against the US
bullying are not only to protect our
legitimate rights and interests but also
to uphold international rules and order
safeguard the common interests of all
countries and maintain international
fairness and justice in the face of US
bullying and hegemony compromise and
concession are not a way out
they're calling the Americans bullies
trump doesn't seem too bothered though
he has repeated his offer donald Trump
wants to sort things out with Xi Jinping
yesterday he called the Chinese
president a friend what happens with
China we would love to be able to work a
deal we're resetting the table and I'm
sure that we'll be able to get along
very well i have great respect for
President Xi he's been in a true sense
he's been a friend of mine for a long
period of time and I think uh that we'll
end up working out something that's very
good for both countries i look forward
to it
trump did not have to wait long for a
response today China's president broke
his silence xi Jinping spoke publicly
for the first time since the trade war
began and his message to President Trump
was clear we won't be making any deals
in fact let me quote from what he said
for over 70 years China's development
has relied on self-reliance and hard
work never on handouts from others and
it is not afraid of any unjust
suppression we are not afraid that is
the message from Xi Jinping and China is
hitting back it is expanding the
battlefield this is not just about
tariffs anymore this dispute is spilling
into other areas like people-to-people
ties china has issued a travel warning
for the US it's on your screen now take
a look beijing has advise for its
citizens traveling to the US it says and
I quote "Fully assess the risk of
traveling to the United States and
travel and to travel with caution." And
that's not all they've also issued an
advisory for students those who are
enrolled in American universities they
have been told to assess and I'm quoting
again assess security risks basically
China feels that American campuses are
not safe anymore that's what it's
telling its
citizens like I said this is not about
tariffs china is firing in all
directions like selling US bonds they're
also called US
treasuries a bond as you would know is
US government debt and China owns US
bonds worth billions of dollars about
760 billion at this point now China
could sell these bonds why does it
matter and how can China weaponize this
U these US
bonds let me explain think of the US
government like a trillionaire
businessman let's name him Uncle Sam
every year Uncle Sam needs money he has
to build new roads new schools uncle Sam
runs hospitals as well and they too need
funding and of course he has to pay
salaries now Uncle Sam does not always
have enough cash to do all of this so he
borrows he asks others to lend him some
cash and he promises that he will pay
back the loan the loan amount plus a
little extra as interest he will pay all
of it back now for this loan Uncle Sam
issues a special contract a contract
that spells out how and when the loan
will be repaid and how much interest
will be paid with it this contract is
called a bond so Uncle Sam has his bonds
ready but who will give him the money he
reaches out to an investor called Dragon
for years investor Dragon has been a
good friend to Uncle Sam he has loaned
Uncle Sam large sums of money and it it
has worked out well for both sides uncle
Sam repays the money on time no missed
payments no
defaults he has been a safe investment
for Investor Dragon but now their deal
is in trouble because Investor Dragon
and Uncle Sam have had a fight they no
longer trust each other so Investor
Dragon has refused new
loans in fact he's asking for his money
back so suddenly there's pressure on
Uncle Sam because he has to repay the
dragon so he must get more money more
loans and because he has upset so many
other people too he has to promise them
more interest in other words the loans
have become more expensive the debt is
piling up uncle Sam cannot keep up with
his payments his entire business starts
feeling this burden of debt he cannot
pay salaries he cannot bid for new
contracts his existing projects slow
down and his entire business comes to a
grinding halt
now let's say Uncle Sam is the US
economy and investor dragon I'm sure
you've guessed it is China what happens
if China walks
away if it starts dumping US bonds or
loans or treasuries whatever you call
it it could crash the US economy at the
same time it would hurt China too like
we just explained this is a double-edged
sword and China would wield it carefully
xi Jinping's statement today shows that
he is not in a hurry he is willing to
drag this out for as long as it takes
and Donald Trump should know
this unlike him Xi Jinping does not have
to face an election he has elected
himself as president for life there is
no one to challenge his authority in
China at this point but Trump does not
have that kind of time or luxury he
wants a deal with China and he wants
China to ask for it we say good luck
with
that
our next story is like the plot twist of
a geopolitical thriller and for that we
are turning to Afghanistan the US wants
to make a comeback to
Afghanistan american military planes
have been spotted at the Bram air base
yes Bram the very same base that
Washington abandoned in 2021 military
equipment worth billions was left behind
not to mention allied Afghan
troops they were all left behind it was
a chaotic exit and a PR disaster for the
world's largest military four years have
gone by there is a new sheriff in town
i'm talking about Donald Trump of course
and now the Americans are making a
U-turn they want Bram back
well here's what we know
on the 7th of April reports emerged
about increased air activity near Kabul
open source flight open source flight
trackers in fact gave a better picture
an American C17 military plane landed in
Bagram it is a massive cargo aircraft it
is hard to miss it reportedly touched
down in Bram but the plane was not empty
it offloaded military hardware and
senior intelligence
officials including the CIA deputy chief
Michael
Ellis clearly the Americans are up to
something and it has the Taliban's stamp
of approval they wouldn't want the
Americans back unless there's a
trade-off more on that later some
reports also say that the Taliban has
handed Bagram back to the US the Taliban
calls it propaganda they say they have
full control of the air base so what's
really happening let's try and break it
down for you the Bram Air Base is
located just north of Kabul it was a
strategic air base for US and NATO
forces it was used to launch air strikes
against Taliban and other terrorist
groups but everything changed in July
2021 then US President Joe Biden
announced an exit americans left
Afghanistan in a hurry the Bram air base
was ditched in the cover of the night
and Taliban seized it within days after
capturing
Kabul four years later the Americans are
desperate to return trump even wants
boots on the ground at Bram listen to
this but we're going to keep Bram not
because of Afghanistan but because of
China because it's exactly 1 hour away
from where China makes its nuclear
missiles so they we're going to keep
Bram we were going to keep a small force
on Bram we're going to have Bram Air
Base one of the biggest air bases in the
world we gave it up and you know who's
occupying it right now china
4 years after a horrible and botched
exit and they want to redeploy troops to
Afghanistan to know shame is to be human
you may have heard this quote
before what does it say about Uncle Sam
trump says "The Bagram air base is
strategic it is close to China's nuclear
missile sides."
Trump also says that Bagram is currently
being occupied by China now we're not
sure about the Chinese presence but the
air base is vital we know that let me
show you on a map bram has two large
runways it has almost 100 parking bays
for military aircraft and the air
strip's location is strategic it would
give Americans closer access to China
particularly
Shenzhen that's where China has several
nuclear missile silos
a flight from Bram to Shinjang is less
than an hour and that's not all the air
base is significant for Trump's Iran
strategy as well bagram means US
military planes will be in Iran's
backyard this is why they're eager to
return it sends a message to Beijing and
Thran trump is trying to kill two birds
with one stone a stone called
Bram but where does that leave the
Taliban they fought a bloody war to keep
the Americans out eventually they had it
their way why would they want the US to
return one could think of two reasons
first security taliban has many rivals
like ISIS
K Islamic State Corasan province the
Taliban sees ISIS K as a challenge to
their authority and then there's
Pakistan taliban and the Pakistan army
have had multiple skirmishes recently so
the US military's return to Bagram means
drone strikes and surveillance against
ISISK it would also force Pakistan to
keep its guns
silent and the Taliban would be happy
with both scenarios
that's the first reason security the
second is money or could be the Taliban
is in dire need of cash allowing
Americans to return to Bagram means one
thing
dollars and the thaw has already begun
last month Taliban released a US citizen
the fourth this year in return the US
has dropped bounties on key Taliban
leaders including a $10 million bounty
on Sirajuin Hakani the man who
masterminded attacks on US forces he was
on the FBI's most wanted list and now
he's
free that's a seismic shift in US policy
and there's more the US wants to resume
consular services in Afghanistan
diplomatic t talks have become
frequent and the Taliban is welcoming
this
discussions were held on Afghanistan US
bilateral relations the release of
prisoners and the provision of
consularor services to Afghans in the
United States the Minister of Foreign
Affairs further emphasized the
importance of resolving issues between
Afghanistan and the United States
through dialogue
so what's next has the US taken over
Bram well for now it is just reports but
don't be surprised if Trump makes a deal
will it be a strategic master stroke or
another disaster in the making we'll
have to wait and see but one thing is
quite clear Bram's story is not
over now back to India new Delhi is
moving quietly making powerful and
hidden moves and I mean this literally a
classified military project is breaking
covers the Indian Navy calls it project
Vsha and this is no ordinary project
project Russia is about a naval base it
will be completed next year that is 2026
it will give India two things first the
Indian Navy will get its very own
nuclear submarine base and second it
will be a unique engineering marvel the
first of its kind this base will be in
the state of Andhra Pradesh in a coastal
city called
Rambili it will be 50 km south of
Vishaka that is where the Indian Navy
has its eastern command and this base is
going to be significant in many ways it
has been in the making for a decade
here's why Rambili was chosen for the
project because of its geography the
water is deep in this area it g it gives
submarines natural cover they can remain
underwater and enter the base which
means they do not have to surface and
blow their cover basically no one will
know when the submarines come and go and
this is perfect for nuclear submarines
because they can stay underwater for
months at a time they only surface for
supplies although India's nuclear
submarines won't even have to do that
they can stay submerged forever and move
into their base without anyone knowing
here's why I say that we know that the
base is in Rambil in Andhra Pradesh but
like the submarines the base too will be
hidden it is fully underground hidden
from satellites even locals do not know
where the base is there are no sign
boards or markers let me also tell you
about its engineering the underground
facility will have a network of tunnels
and pens it will discreetly house
India's nuclear submarine
fleet india already has two nuclear
submarines the INS Ahant and the INS
Arihat a third one will be commissioned
this year it is being called the INS
Aridhan a fourth one is already under
construction in total India plans to
operate 10 nuclear submarines and this
base will be home to all of them it is
significant for two more reasons one it
enhances India's naval capacity and two
it sends a message that India is serious
about its security it is expanding its
second strike capabilities what does
that mean what are second strike
capabilities you see India has a no
first use nuclear doctrine
a no first use doctrine in simpler words
it basically means that India will not
use nuclear weapons first it will only
use nukes to retaliate when attacked by
a nuclear weapon that is no first use
and this is what makes India a
responsible power it sees nuclear
weapons as a deterrent a way to prevent
war contrast that with others like
India's neighbor Pakistan they have a
firstus nuclear doctrine they see
nuclear weapons as tools of war so India
is safeguarding its nuclear assets and
the hidden base helps it will protect
the nuclear
submarines this is also a message to
China beijing has increased its activity
in the Indian Ocean their so-called
research vessels are constantly being
nosy they frequently visit waters around
India and the Chinese maritime activity
is only growing this includes the
presence of Chinese submarines in the
Indian
Ocean the Indian Navy has also detected
them so it is working to counter the
threat with the help of a nuclear
submarine
base India strategy is clear match power
with power the Indian Navy is preparing
for the long game a game of silence
strength and submarines
winter is the coldest season of the year
in India it goes it goes on from
December to early April that is what the
country's weather body says the Indian
Met Department or IMD but in today's
rapidly heating world this
categorization is a tough cell for
instance IMD classifies the month of
February as winter but this year
February was the hottest in the last 125
years
march 2 broke heat records across many
Indian states and now April is here it
is supposed to be the spring season but
this April is less about picnicking
under the blooming trees and more about
applying and reapplying sunscreen it is
less spring and more summer in fact the
IMD has already sounded an alarm it has
warned of high temperatures in northern
India across states like Hana Punjab
Rajasthan Gujarat and the capital Delhi
this week temperatures already crossing
40° C yesterday Delhi recorded a maximum
temperature of 40.2° C it is expected to
hit 41 in the coming days 41° C the IMD
has sounded a yellow alert until
tomorrow now this department the the Med
Department has four colorcoded warnings
green yellow orange and red these depend
on the severity of the weather
conditions so Delhi's yellow alert means
that it will be hot but tolerable for
the general public though it can trigger
health concerns for vulnerable groups
like infants and the
elderly the state of Punjab has also
received a yellow heatwave alert in
Gujarat things are much worse though the
temperature has already reached 45° C in
Gujarat a severe heat wave is expected
the state was on red alert yesterday now
it has been downgraded to an orange
alert until Thursday
so northern India is already reeling
under extreme heat and it is a sign of
things to come you see India usually
sees heat waves during summer normally
they start occurring from the end of
April but over the past few years spring
season has shrunk heat waves are
arriving earlier lasting longer and
becoming much worse last year in fact
was particularly bad every state in the
country except a few in the northeast
experienced a heat wave 2024 saw the
highest number of heatwave days in 15
years india recorded its hottest day
ever at
50.5° C in Rajasthan as per government
data 161 people died of heat stroke
across the country though independent
experts say the number could be as high
as 733 733 and this summer things are
only expected to get worse according to
India's weather chief most of India will
experience an intense heat wave several
states will experience more heatwave
days than usual and above normal
temperatures that will be the new normal
so India is India prepared for this can
the world's most populous nation handle
the heat waves it knows are
coming according to experts India's
level of preparedness has improved the
IMD puts out mostly accurate forecasts
it tracks impending heat waves it alerts
states and districts about a week in
advance and governments begin executing
their heat action plan think of it as a
localized early warning system and a
preparedness plan it is used during
extreme heat events to coordinate
response and to combat the impact of
heat at least 23 states have developed
heat action plans many of them use
lowcost easy interventions like the
creation of shades in public spaces
boosting the availability of water
distribution of oral hydration solutions
rehydration solutions rather
OS and shifting timings for schools and
offices experts say these measures have
been effective but we are not heat proof
yet there is more work to be done
according to recent assessments India
needs more long-term intervention
including better preparation in
hospitals better fire management systems
and greener cities the goal should not
be to wait for a heat wave and then
scramble to cope it should go beyond
that it should involve solutions that
can bring down local temperatures
because sure climate change is a new
normal it comes with life-changing
consequences but unlike many of them
heat waves can be largely managed if and
only if timely actions are
initiated so it will take both
prevention and cure for India to take
the
heat since the beginning of time 5
billion species have existed on Earth
99.9% of them have vanished they have
become extinct meaning they no longer
exist
as morbid as this is extinction is a
part of nature but what if it is not
forever that's what what an American
startup has dared to ask and now for the
first time in the world it has brought
back an extinct species a species of
wolf a top predator that once roamed
North America i'm talking about the dire
wolf it died out about 12,500 years ago
but now it is back
how did that happen and should you be
excited about this deextinction or
should you be worried our next report
tells
you this is the howl of the dire wolf it
has not been heard in more than 12,500
years because that's when this fearsome
wolf species went extinct but now in a
world first it is back american biotech
company Colossal Biosciences claims to
have achieved this milestone the same
company that is trying to resurrect the
mammoth dodo and Tasmanian tiger and
last month used mammoth DNA to create a
woolly mouse now it has created three
dire wolves they are snowy white puppies
and they have been doing what most wolf
pups do howling napping chasing and
tustling but they are nothing like the
other pups that roam the earth they are
the result of a high-tech challenge
their genetic makeup has been hacked
with advanced tools and ancient
DNA the DNA of direwolves the same
animals that inspired the canine Inosian
Dyrus on the popular TV series Game of
Thrones these top predators once roamed
North America until they went extinct
they were larger in size than grey
wolves they had a wider head thicker fur
and a stronger jaw
scientists know this because plenty of
their remains have been discovered
across America and this is what gave
Colossal the opportunity to de-extinct
the species they took DNA extracted from
two dire wolf fossils from a
13,000-year-old tooth and a
72,000year-old skull they used it to
make sets of genetic information then
they altered cells of grey wolves the
prehistoric wolf's closest living
relative this process is called gene
editing basically certain greywolf gene
variants were taken and replaced with
traits associated with dire wolves this
helped create embryos of the direwolves
which were then transferred into
surrogates mixed breed specifically
large domestic dogs because dog breeding
is better understood than that of wolves
as a result two male dire wolf pups were
born in October 2024 and a female pup
was born in January 2025 this is a
scientific milestone but it has raised a
range of questions first scientists
wonder if this is even de-extinction
since most of the genome is that of a
greywolf not the
direwolf so yes they have slightly
genetically modified wolves maybe um and
that's probably the best that you're
going to get and those slight
modifications seem to have been derived
from retrieved direwolf material does
that make it a direwolf no does it make
a slightly modified greywolf yes and
that's probably about it secondly
critics are worried about the pups they
are currently living on an 8sqm site at
an undisclosed location enclosed by a
10-ft tall fencing they are constantly
monitored by drones and security guards
but they are effectively alone they are
at the age when their parents would
teach them to hunt but they have none
scientists know little about what
diseases they could catch or how they
would replicate genetic engineering is a
nent field it has been about three
decades since Dolly the sheep was cloned
but other cloned animals still have
problems such as organ defects premature
aging and immune system issues it also
imperils living animals who are used as
surrogates thirdly critics also question
the very concept of deextinction
colossal has raised at least $435
million since it was founded in
2021 and this is not the only company
raising huge sums of money and trying to
reverse extinction so what if this money
was instead invested in projects that
could save the living animals that could
protect the 47,000 endangered species
the world over instead of raising hybrid
creatures so breeding extinct wolves is
a scientific breakthrough but it is not
without a pack of complications and if
humans are playing God they should hope
that critics are just crying wolf and
not foreshadowing
what an eventful week it has been the US
was committed to its tariffs until
midweek but late on Wednesday they made
a U-turn president Donald Trump decided
to pause his tariffs for 90
days then yesterday the White House
posted a message on social media a
warning in all caps do not retaliate and
you will be rewarded no context no
picture no further explanation just a
war warning in all caps of course the
White House was talking about tariffs
but social media users had other ideas
they began using the message in their
own wild scenarios take a
