sharma

markets have crashed in the us they've
seen a swing of some $7 trillion
european stocks are tanking asia has
been the worst hit economists are
predicting a recession and trump is
showing no signs of slowing down so what
is the endgame of this trade war what is
india's strategy is it talks or tit for
tat did trump crash the markets on
purpose speculation is rife after he
says they needed a bitter pill is his
own party now gunning for him the

heat heat
investors cannot catch a break us
president donald trump's relentless
assault on global stock markets
continues stocks across the board
crashed again today and it was worse
than last week it is being called a
black monday panic has swept through the
markets from mumbai to tokyo in india
the sensex crashed over 2200 points and
the nifty fell by over 3% below the
22,200
mark in one day investors have lost over
13 lakh crore rupees in india that's
around 150 billion this money has
vanished from the bombay stock exchange
alone needless to say the sell-off was
brutal every sector was in the in the
red deep in the red it's the same story
across asia tokyo's nikai dropped by
over
8% taiwan's tx fell by almost 10% in
both markets the circuit breaker was
triggered what is the circuit breaker if
the stock prices rally or fall way too
quickly the markets hit a pause button
this gives a moment to all investors to
calm down and think before making any
decisions today markets in japan and
taiwan hit the bottom circuit meaning
they crashed hard and they crashed way
too fast so trading had to be suspended
to stop further panic selling in hong
kong things were equally bad their stock
market is called the hang sen it
suffered its steepest decline since 1997
we're talking about a slump of
13% it was so bad that china's sovereign
wealth fund had to intervene they bought
shares to stabilize the market the
picture looks quite scary there is panic
and fear it has all been triggered by
donald trump by his sweeping tariffs on
us trade partners over the weekend trump
doubled down on his plan china what's
going to happen with the market i can't
tell you but i can tell you our country
has gotten a lot stronger and
eventually it'll be a country like no
other it'll be the most dominant country
economically in the world
trump's tariffs have hit everyone
america's allies and adversaries but it
is asia that is suffering the most it
seems and that's because asia is a major
manufacturing hub its economy depends on
exports to the us trump has placed some
of the highest tariffs on this region
just look at the rates japan and south
korea face
26% duties india again 26% thailand
36% vietnam 46% cambodia 49% and china a
whopping 54% tariffs so clearly asia is
bearing the brunt its economies are
under intense pressure but americans
will feel the pain too us investors are
sounding an alarm a recession looks
increasingly likely america's top banks
are giving ominous predictions the
latest one to do so is goldman sachs it
says there's a 45% chance of a recession
last week jp morgan had revised its
forecast it raised the the possibility
of a recession to
60% and both these banks have blamed the
trump tariffs for this state of affairs
they've termed it a risk to the us
economy
of course the us president disagrees he
calls the tariffs a medicine a medicine
which the us economy must take his
treasury secretary has also defended the
tariffs
mr secretary how difficult is it going
to be and how long are americans going
to have to hang tough well again i
reject that assumption there doesn't
have to be a recession who knows how the
market is going to react in a day in a
week what we're looking at is building
the long-term economic fundamentals for
prosperity that i think the previous
administration had put us on the course
toward financial calamity
but investors are starting to push back
one of them is bill aman the billionaire
hedge fund manager this is a man who had
backed donald trump he agreed that
global trade needs to be rebalanced but
now he feels that trump has gone too far
he is calling for a 90day pause on the
tariff
plan or a timeout as he called it aman
believes us trade partners should use
this window they should negotiate deals
with the trump administration otherwise
the fallout could be severe in fact let
me quote aman if on the other hand on
april 9th we launch economic nuclear war
on every country in the world business
investment will grind to a halt
consumers will close their wallets and
pocketbooks and we will severely damage
our reputation with the rest of the
world that will take years and
potentially decades to rehabilitate
jamie diamond has echoed bill aman's
concerns jaime diamond is the chairman
of jp morgan chase it is america's
biggest bank diamond says the tariffs
would and i'm quoting again push up
prices for
americans so basically wall street is
calling for restraint only a climb down
by president trump would calm the
markets the question is will he consider
it reports say trump could be mulling a
90-day pause in these tariffs all
countries except china could get this
temporary reprieve a 90-day pause
basically trump would delay the tariffs
that's what the report said the markets
heaved a sigh of relief but then the
white house issued a statement calling
these reports fake news and on q the
markets fell
again we're talking about the us markets
they opened just a few hours back and
they remain volatile in fact since
trump's tariff announcement us stocks
have lost over $6 trillion in market
value the trump presidency is not
working out for wall street at all since
inauguration day in january since donald
trump's inauguration as president us
stocks have lost a record 11 trillion in
value 11 trillion europe 2 is mirroring
asia's losses germany's dax france's cac
and uk's footsie 100 all of them fell by
over 5%
today you see markets need a semblance
of certainty and
continuity but this is a shakeup of
seismic
proportions no wonder there's hysteria
and it's far from over if donald trump
stays the course the worst may be yet to
come
heat hey heat hey heat
panic is the mood right now you look at
investors you look at government
officials everyone is panicking but here
in new delhi the government seems
relaxed at least on the outside that is
there's been no retaliation no
condemnation and no panicking from new
delhi very different from china or the
european union
indian officials say they will not
announce retaliatory tariffs and why is
that because they see a number of silver
linings number one india has already
started trade talks with the us prime
minister modi traveled to washington dc
in february he and president trump
kicked off trade negotiations they
agreed to conclude it before
2026 so basically india feels or indian
officials feel that india has a head
start
number two the rates on india are
relatively lower we've been telling you
about this our tariff rate is 26% for
vietnam it is 46% for thailand 36% and
for bangladesh 37% basically other asian
producers are worse off and finally
number three trump did hint at a
possible reprieve his offer was quite
simple reduce your tariffs and i will
help you out this too has given indian
officials confidence
but what about indian
investors no such joy the sell-off
continued today as well the sensex lost
more than 2200 points it closed nearly
3% down and the nifty lost over 700
points in today's trade closing 3.2%
lower the markets had their worst day in
10 months investors lost around 13 lakh
crore rupees on paper that's around $150
billion and remember the tariffs have
not been imposed yet only the 10%
baseline rate has been imposed or has
come into effect the rest is supposed to
come into effect on
wednesday what will happen then probably
more pain some trade groups have done
the calculation they expect india's
exports to the us to reduce by
$5.7 billion that's almost 6.4% drop in
exports it's different for each sector
seafood exports could fall by 20% iron
and steel by 18% diamonds and gold by
15% and electronics by
12% this could be the impact of trump's
tariffs plus there'll be the knock-on
effect industries need workers when
demand is rising when they have to
produce more they need more people but
if the demand is falling the opposite
could happen
they will try to produce less and by
extension perhaps lay off
people will this hurt india's economic
growth economists say it will they say
the tariffs will reduce india's gdp
growth by 20 to 40 basis points but the
government disagrees they say the
original target can still be met which
is between 6.3 and 6.8% that is what
india is eyeing in terms of gdp growth
either way the timing of these tariffs
is not ideal india's growth slowed down
last year there were signs of stress in
household consumption and now there's
talk of a debt
bubble as you know micro credit is huge
in india there are loans given outside
the traditional banking system they not
do not require collateral and millions
of indians depend on this micro finance
industry it is worth almost $45 billion
but reports say it could now be under
pressure around 68% of the borrowers are
showing signs of distress many of them
have started to
default look at the numbers in 2023 less
than 1% of the loans were overdue now it
is more than 3% around 27% of the
borrowers are taking new loans to repay
old ones which is a classic sign of
danger india's credit card numbers are
also blinking red more indians have
started using credit cards since the
pandemic the spending has tripled since
2021 unfortunately the dues are also
piling up
in
2024 credit card npa surged by more than
28% npa as you would know are
non-performing assets npa you have 90
days or 3 months to pay the interest or
principle on your card if you don't do
that in 90 days it becomes an npa and
these npa are piling up they stood at
around 5,300 cr rupees in december 2023
5,300 crores by december last year they
rose to more than 6,700 cr rupees so npa
have shot up by 500% since
2020 again it's a clear sign of danger
it is in this context that india is
dealing with trump's tariffs now in a
con in a context of
uncertainty that's also why india is
being
patient there is no point in retaliating
and poking trump further there's also no
point in reaching out to agencies like
the wto the world trade organization so
the best option at the moment is to seek
out a deal
is there pain in the market at some
point you're unwilling to tolerate the i
think your question is so stupid i mean
i think it's a i don't want anything to
go down but sometimes you have to take
medicine to fix something
i want more people to show up and uh get
him out of office he's
terrible donald trump announced the
tariffs last week the world first
blinked then it panicked then markets
crashed and then trillions were wiped
off just today the s&p 500 added and
erased $2.5 trillion in one hour all on
the basis of what was later called a
fake news headline $2.5
trillion but the us president does not
seem to care he does not think it's a
it's a bad thing in fact trump believes
that this is exactly what america needs
a bitter pill is there pain in the
market at some point you're unwilling to
tolerate i i think your question is so
stupid i mean i think it's a i don't
want anything to go down but sometimes
you have to take medicine to fix
something
which has led many to ask the question
did trump do it on purpose did he want
the markets to crash i know it's a weird
question to ask but there's no smoke
without fire and the fire was lit by the
president himself on friday he reposted
a video link on his social media
platform truth social the video is by a
tik tok user and this is what he's
suggesting
trump is crashing the market on purpose
trump is crashing the stock market by
20% this month but he's doing it on
purpose and this is why warren buffett
just said trump is making the best
economic moves he's seen in over 50
years now here's the secret game he's
playing and it could make you rich
so how does this even work the video
claims that this is like a wild chess
move trump imposes the tariffs the
market crashes he forces money into us
treasury bonds the fed cuts interest
rates lower rates mean lower mortgage
payments the dollar becomes weaker
companies end up making more in america
so grocery prices tumble and somehow the
middle class is
saved it sounds convoluted it also
sounds like a classic conspiracy theory
because it most probably is the funny
part is that trump seems to be backing
it in fact this has been his position
and calculation
throughout look at his latest post on
truth social trump says and i'm quoting
"oil prices are down interest rates are
down food prices are down and there is
no inflation
and the longtime abused usa is bringing
in billions of dollars a week from the
abusing countries on tariffs that are
already in
place so trump clearly believes that
tariffs are a good thing that this is
america's bitter pill but is the bitter
pill too bitter americans certainly
think so they have been protesting in
all 50 states thousands of americans
took to the streets over the weekend
they had just two words for their
president hands off
i think it's important to speak up i
think silence is not an option i think
you have to stay engaged you have to
stay vigilant i think it's is not only
for our community at large but the world
at large i think that enough is enough
we object to the uh everything that uh
donald trump is doing basically in terms
of his power grab and all the damage
he's doing to the economy and to
democracy that's why i'm i'm saying the
trump slump is
basically the the stock market's
crashing the economy is going to crash
it's already crashing and it's it's all
about trump it's all his his actions his
stupidity his
uh mistakes
the protest stretched from new york to
los angeles around 600,000 people signed
up organizers claimed the number was
more than a million either way anger is
clearly in the air not just at rallies
or on the streets but also in quieter
battlegrounds like grocery lines in less
than two weeks america will celebrate
easter but this year the easter bunnies
got budget issues because americans
cannot even afford eggs back in february
prices cracked a record $8 for a dozen
eggs prices have dipped a little since
but they are still not exactly sunny
side up and eggs are not just for
breakfast they are an easter tradition
so americans are turning to the next
best thing dyed potatoes for instance
because they're cheap others are
stuffing plastic cases some are also
eyeing golf
balls basically anything cheaper and
round that can be passed off as eggs and
this is just one example americans are
rushing to stock up on things on
groceries on apparel even on furniture
some in fact are buying cars too all
before tariffs cause a massive price
hike but will any of this force trump to
rethink his policy it looks unlikely at
the moment trump is still selling his
tariffs as some kind of miracle
cure the markets are swallowing that
medicine and they're showing serious
side effects like panic plummeting
portfolios and economic
indigestion but even trump must know
that playing jenga with the economy is a
risky game so this is where america is
at the moment caught between a president
prescribing economic shock therapy and a
public tired of being the guinea pig
donald trump calls his plan visionary
his critics call it volatile because for
team trump it may be a highstakes
experiment in power but for millions of
americans it's a battle for
survival they say good economics is bad
politics but guess what bad economics
can also be bad politics in america the
republican party is learning it the hard
way it's the party that runs washington
right now it is donald trump's party the
president who has unleashed
tariffs economists think it is a bad
strategy interestingly politicians think
the same because the tariffs have
angered their voters american citizens
they're very upset they're protesting
they're demanding a roll back but trump
is sticking to his guns and caught in
this crossfire is the republican party
also called the
gop the grand old party
they feel the tariffs will backfire so
they're now gunning for
trump the first shot came from ted cruz
he is a republican senator from texas he
has warned and i'm quoting here he has
warned of a bloodbath in the midterms
that's the midterm election next year
he's talking about ted cruz says the
president is destroying the american
economy and he is not alone at least
seven senior republicans have expressed
similar concerns like senator chuck
grassley of iowa he recently
co-sponsored a bipartisan bill
bipartisan means it is supported by both
parties the republicans and the
democrats so chuck grassley is teaming
with the other side and that's some
serious rebellion within the
gop and do you know what the legislation
is for to limit donald trump's power to
impose tariffs and that's not all for
every new tariff that trump imposes he
has 48 hours to explain why he's doing
so that's what this bill says also all
new tariffs will expire in 60 days if
not approved by the us congress now
these are some serious measures to check
the president's power guess where
they're coming from his own party the
gop it is going through a crisis and the
tariffs have become a litmus test
republicans are worried about the
midterms next year about how they will
perform as a party you see last year in
november they rode the maga wave they
won the race to the white house they
also swept the us congress which is
america's version of a parliament the
republicans now have a majority in the
senate and the house of representatives
the speaker of the house is republican
this is one of the most powerful
positions on capitol hill the house
speaker republicans also decide which
bills are tabled for voting so
controlling both these houses both
houses of congress is clearly important
they have that control now they may not
have it next year they fear they could
lose this majority after the midterm
elections which are basically elections
held in the middle of a us president's
tenure hence the name midterm seats in
the house and the senate are up for
grabs it's like a reshuffle americans
use it to show what they think of the
current
administration so the midterms are
important they will shape what is left
of trump's second
term and that is why the republicans are
tense the trump tariffs are putting
loyalties to the test and it's not just
the republican party even trump's
biggest supporter is having cold feet
we're talking about elon musk the
billionaire has finally broken his
silence and this time he's not defending
his president elon musk said that he
wants zero tariffs he's calling for more
free trade he wants a zero tariff
corridor but only between the us and
europe listen to this i'm hopeful for
example with the tariffs that that uh at
the end of the day it i hope it is
agreed that both europe and the united
states should move ideally in my view to
a zero tariff situation effectively
creating a free trade zone between
europe and north america
so musk wants the tariffs gone he's
advocating for free trade it is not the
loudest criticism of the president but
it is criticism indeed and it is coming
from donald trump's closest ally elon
musk put everything on the line to have
trump reelected he poured billions of
dollars he held rallies on behalf of the
republican and he promised to ring in a
new america with
trump now that support looks
sticky an eye for an eye makes the whole
world blind a saying attributed to
mahatma gandhi it means that seeking
revenge creates a cycle of
suffering but it is the dominant
sentiment in the world right now
countries around the world have reacted
to donald trump's tariffs they are not
happy canada said it will fight the
tariffs germany called them and i quote
nonsense italy said the tariffs will
weaken the west world leaders are
calling for retaliation they're gearing
up for a trade war one that they never
started
as trump unleashes his tariffs our next
report tells you how countries around
the world are responding trade war is in
nobody's interest our old relationship
of steadily deepening integration with
the united states is over when the
united states embraced the mantle of
global economic leadership is over
president trump's tariffs is a major
blow to the world economy well this is a
tragedy it is also the new reality
us president donald trump has unleashed
a trade war his tariffs on all countries
is pushing economies to the
brink on one hand americans are
protesting against their president
republicans are breaking ranks and even
trump's closest ally elon musk is
questioning the
move but donald trump is doubling down
and now the world is reacting
the strongest rebuttal has come from
america's northern neighbor donald trump
has imposed a 25% tariff on canada and
ottawa has promised to
retaliate prime minister mark khani says
he will fight tariffs with tariffs and
that canada will lead the trade war
against the united states our old
relationship of steadily deepening
integration with the united states is
over the 80-year period when the united
states embraced the mantle of global
economic leadership when it forged
alliances rooted in trust and mutual
respect and championed the free and open
exchange of goods and services is over
kani has also announced that canada will
review its weapons deal with the us this
includes the deal of f-35 stealth
fighter jets we're looking on
diversification in terms of maritime uh
procurement and other aspects of
procurement we're reviewing uh the f-35
uh fighters to make sure that that's the
right approach for the country uh going
forward given the other considerations
then there's the united kingdom prime
minister kia starmer says that a trade
war was in nobody's interest as it would
only hurt the global economy starmer has
announced that he will protect british
interests and that all options are on
the table
i mean we have our own um trading
relationship with the us it is actually
a fair and balanced relationship if you
look at the numbers um and of course
we've got decades worth of a special
relationship with the um united states
um and i think it's by focusing on those
features that we can take uh the
necessary steps uh to secure our economy
um through hopefully a deal with options
on the table if that's not possible
joining the uk is europe germany has
warned that a trade war will only hurt
the united states
spain says it will do quote unquote
everything to protect its interests
meanwhile donald trump's ally italian
prime minister georgia maloney expressed
disappointment she said italy never
wanted to be part of a trade war meloney
has now pledged to protect italian
businesses greece and sweden have also
condemned the
tariffs while europe is preparing for a
trade war there's one country that's
escalating it
china beijing has dropped all calls for
negotiations in fact china is
intensifying the trade war they have
increased tariffs on american goods
china is now levying 34% tariffs on all
us
exports beijing says it's determined to
meet trump headon meanwhile india is
taking a more sensible approach it's
calling for cooperation not
confrontation
new delhi is seeking a bilateral trade
agreement with washington and trump says
he's open to such deals the us president
has set the global economy on fire while
some countries like china are fanning
the flames india is being more
responsible by looking to firefight the
global
uncertainty now back to india and new
delhi is moving quietly making powerful
and hidden moves and i mean this
literally a classified military project
is breaking covers the indian navy calls
it project vara and this is no ordinary
project project vasha is about a naval
base it will be completed next year that
is 2026 it will give india two things
first the indian navy will get its very
own nuclear submarine base and second it
will be a unique engineering marvel the
first of its kind this base will be in
the state of andhra pradesh in a coastal
city called
rambili it will be 50 kilometers south
of vishaka patnam that is where the
indian navy has its eastern command and
this base is going to be significant in
many ways it has been in the making for
a decade here's why rambili was chosen
for the project because of its geography
the water is deep in this area it g it
gives submarines natural cover they can
remain underwater and enter the base
which means they do not have to surface
and blow their cover basically no one
will know when the submarines come and
go and this is perfect for nuclear
submarines because they can stay
underwater for months at a time they
only surface for supplies although
india's nuclear submarines won't even
have to do that they can stay submerged
forever and move into their base without
anyone knowing here's why i say that we
know that the base is in rambili in
andhra pradesh but like the submarines
the base too will be hidden it is fully
underground hidden from satellites even
locals do not know where the bases there
are no sign boards or markers let me
also tell you about its engineering the
underground facility will have a network
of tunnels and pens it will discreetly
house india's nuclear submarine fleet
india already has two nuclear submarines
the ins ahant and the ins arihat a third
one will be commissioned this year it is
being called the ins aridhan a fourth
one is already under construction in
total india plans to operate 10 nuclear
submarines and this base will be home to
all of them it is significant for two
more reasons one it enhances india's
naval capacity and two it sends a
message that india is serious about its
security it is expanding its second
strike capabilities what does that mean
what are second strike capabilities you
see india has a no first use nuclear
doctrine
a no first use doctrine in simpler words
it basically means that india will not
use nuclear weapons first it will only
use nukes to retaliate when attacked by
a nuclear weapon that is no first use
and this is what makes india a
responsible power it sees nuclear
weapons as a deterrent a way to prevent
war contrast that with others like
india's neighbor pakistan they have a
firstus nuclear doctrine they see
nuclear weapons as tools of war
so india is safeguarding its nuclear
assets and the hidden base helps it will
protect the nuclear
submarines this is also a message to
china beijing has increased its activity
in the indian ocean their so-called
research vessels are constantly being
nosy they frequently visit waters around
india and the chinese maritime activity
is only growing this includes the
presence of chinese submarines in the
indian ocean
the indian navy has also detected them
so it is working to counter the threat
with the help of a nuclear submarine
base india strategy is clear match power
with power the indian navy is preparing
for the long game a game of silence
strength and
submarines so india is boosting its
defense capabilities and our rivals well
they're also building new facilities
that
too with help from our old friend
bangladesh reports say china will build
an airfield in
bangladesh let me pull up the map first
the airfield could come up in this
region lmoner hart in the
north look at how close it is to india's
northeast especially the chicken's neck
as you know the chicken's neck is a
narrow strip of land it connects india's
northeast to the mainland you cut it off
and you cut off india's northeast an
airfield near this region is bad enough
but a chinese airfield if true it would
be a major security
threat reports say india is studying
these plans chances are it came up only
last week during muhammad ununus's trip
to china the official statements did not
mention it but ununus did say something
strange while he was in beijing listen
to this seven states of india eastern
part of india called seven sisters they
are landlocked country landlock region
of india they have no way to reach out
to the ocean we are the only guardian of
the ocean for all this region so this
opens up a huge possibility so this
could be an extension of the chinese
economy
that statement confused a lot of people
if ununus wanted chinese investments he
could have just asked for it instead he
talked about india's northeast how the
region was landlocked and how bangladesh
was the only guardian days later reports
talk about a chinese
airfield coincidence i don't think so
and the trouble does not end here there
could be a pakistani angle as well
reports say the airfield's construction
will begin by october and a pakistani
firm will be the
subcontractor so china could plan and
pay for the project meanwhile pakistan
could build it this proposal could be
the agenda or on the agenda later this
month pakistan is sending two top
officials to dhaka their foreign
secretary will visit bangladesh on the
17th of april their foreign minister
ishad ddar will visit on april 24th this
will be the first ministerial trip since
2012 and it should not surprise anyone
since taking office muhammad ununus has
had just one goal push india and
bangladesh
apart traditionally dhaka has depended
on new delhi for its needs whether it's
medical tourism or infrastructure
assistance or river water projects they
depended on india but ununice does not
like that and he is not just replacing
india he is provoking us consider the
thistista river project bangladesh wants
to protect and conserve this
river the plan is to dredge portions of
it construct reservoirs and build
townships on either bank last year india
agreed to implement this project it
wanted to keep china away from the
thistista river again same concern too
close to india's northeast and sheik
hassina had agreed to give india
priority but mouhammad ununus is asking
china to help out
like i said it's not just about
replacing india it's about undermining
india
security the question is how can india
respond how should india respond last
week prime minister modi met muhammad
yunus the differences were quite evident
also evident was dhaka's double game
after the meeting they released an
official statement the bangladeshies
they released a statement and several
parts of it seemed questionable for
example the statement claimed that prime
minister modi called shikh hassa
disrespectful indian officials later
dismissed this account they called it
mischievous and politically motivated it
tells you who you're dealing with a
regime that cannot be trusted not even
to release an unadulterated press
statement having said that it's a
reality that india must deal with
muhammad ununus is keen to build a new
alliance in south asia a nexus with
china and pakistan so it's up to india
to be prepared the indian military has a
strong presence in the northeast it must
study and plan for these chinese designs
at the same time a diplomatic campaign
is necessary a campaign to build
pressure for elections in
dhaka because eunus is an unelected
interim leader he should not be taking
such crucial decisions if he continues
to have his way he could do irreparable
damage to india bangladesh ties let's
hope it does not come to
that now let's talk about saudi arabia
in a sudden move riyad has suspended
short-term visas for indians the ban is
temporary it starts from april 13th it
will last until the hajj
ends but what triggered this move last
year's hajj tragedy where around 1,000
pilgrims died many of the victims were
unregistered pilgrims you see there are
special hajj visas for the pilgrimage
but a lot of people use their regular
travel visa for the hajj and this leads
to overcrowding saudi officials want to
avoid that they've raised the penalties
for violators including a jail term for
those who go to the hajj without the
right visa our next report has more
details
it's one of the key pillars for
followers of the islamic faith
performing the hajj at least once in
their lifetime
that often means withstanding days of
extreme heat and outdoor exertion last
year at the hajj over 1,000 pilgrims had
died due to heat exhaustion when
temperatures soared above
50° many of these victims were
unregistered this included some pilgrims
from india too they didn't come on a
valid hajj visa instead they used other
short-term visas they were on their own
they avoided the official process they
weren't assigned proper housing or
medical support the result was
tragic saudi authorities don't want a
repeat of last year so they've hit pause
on short-term visas for indians from
midappril till june no umrah tourist
business or family visas will be issued
to indian nationals that's right before
hajj the ban applies on 14 countries in
all if you already have a valid visa you
can still travel but only until 13th
april after that the doors close until
the pilgrimage ends the message from
saudi authorities is clear if you're
planning to perform hajj you must go
through the official route here in india
that means applying through the hajj
committee of india the only body
authorized to organize the
pilgrimage india sends one of the
largest groups of hajj pilgrims every
year last year alone over 175,000
pilgrims had traveled to saudi arabia so
a large presence of unregistered
pilgrims becomes a crowd management
issue for saudi authorities which is why
the visa curbs make sense
saudi arabia is also tightening
enforcement non-registered pilgrims face
tough penalties now if you're caught
performing hajj without the right visa
you could face a fine of around
$2,600 violators can even be
jailed authorities are even seizing
vehicles and properties used to help
people stay illegally already over
18,000 violators have been detained some
visa holders are still allowed to travel
like any indian resident living in saudi
arabia with a valid saudi residence
permit hajj specific visas issued
through the official kota are still
valid but if you're planning an umrah
trip before hajj or just visiting family
or doing business you'll have to wait
this is just a temporary pause limited
to short-term visas only but it's one
that comes with a clear
warning in japan rice is not just food
it is sacred it is tied it is tied to
ancestors and shinto gods it is served
at weddings it is offered at shrines so
japan does not treat rice like a
commodity it regulates it like a
national treasure which is why a recent
headline has raised questions in the
country japan is dipping into its
emergency rice reserves to regulate rice
prices in the country this is a reserve
meant only for the worst of
disasters so this is not just a policy
move it is a signal that something has
gone seriously wrong with japan's rice
production
why is the country running low on a crop
that it practically worships our next
report tells you
the summer of 2023 wasn't kind across
japan the heat was relentless scorching
temperatures swept through the islands
patties that once shimmered with promise
dried up under the blazing sun rain came
but too little or all at once so the
rice didn't stand a chance the harvest
came in weak grains were underdeveloped
and just as people started to worry
about supply nature doubled down
earthquakes rocked the country one after
another it sent people to the stores
panicking and of course rice disappeared
first now japan doesn't treat rice like
any other crop it's carefully protected
grown under government guidance managed
through cooperatives and priced in a way
that tries to keep farmers afloat the
government tightly controls how much
rice is grown each year it's all about
balance but when you throw a heat wave a
few quakes and a touch of inflation into
the mix that balance starts to
crack in 2023 farmers actually harvested
more rice than the year before about
180,000 tons more but here's the twist
distributors bought 230,000 tons less
somewhere between the rice fields and
the dinner plates rice was
vanishing some say it was logistics
others think businesses and households
began hoarding maybe it was a mix of
both so japan started running out of
rice and the prices started rising
i'm buying rice less and less frequently
and sometimes replacing it with packaged
noodles like udon or yakasoba because
they're cheaper
i still do buy rice occasionally but
since it's so expensive i sometimes give
up on buying it once i see the price
so japan decided to dip into its
strategic reserves of rice think of it
like a national treasure chest but
filled with rice the government holds
around 1 million tons it is auctioning
around 231,000 tons of rice that's
1/5ifth of the total reserves and it's
the not the first time it dipped into
this reserve after the 2011 earthquake
and tsunami also after the 2016 kumamoto
earthquake but this is the first time it
is doing it due to distribution issues
to alleviate the market situation
naturally you would think the government
needs to release double the amount of
what's needed so even if the government
releases 210,000 tons the situation
would not get better for a small
retailer like me
japan's rice prices may go down with the
reserves hitting the shelves but one
problem still persists them japan is
slowly running out of people to grow its
rice the average japanese rice farmer is
over 70 years old young people aren't
taking over the work is hard the profits
are low and the countryside is emptying
out even if demand rises who will grow
the rice that's a question japan will
have to answer soon this is a country
where rice isn't just food it is in many
ways a symbol of national
identity but climate change is shifting
growing seasons rural populations are
dwindling the younger generation isn't
flocking to farming and a food system
built on tradition is struggling to
adapt can japan continue to micromanage
rice production or will this rice-loving
nation have to rethink how it feeds
itself forget friday the 13th the new
horror show is monday the 7th today the
world woke up to a rude shock that
economics is real it's not something
made up by students who hate science it
is real and it is powerful just ask
donald trump his tariffs questioned all
economic sense every expert told him it
would backfire yet what did he do he did
it anyway trump is not feeling the pinch
of his tariffs of course he's a
billionaire and the sitting us president
but guess who is feeling the pinch
ordinary consumers and investors they're
so angry they're making memes about the
crashing markets take a look
oh come on
for
decades that's a very bad idea
now it's time for vantage shots images
that tell the story bolsaro supporters
rally in brazil sao paulo as a former
president faces trial for an alleged
coup attempt a parachutist was rescued
after getting caught on the rugby
stadium's roof in france and a nasa
astronaut captures the northern lights
from the international space station
finally we taking you back in history on
this day in 1994 long-standing ethnic
tensions and political conflict led to
the rwanda genocide over 800,000 people
were killed in 100 days it is one of the
darkest episodes in modern day africa
we're leaving you on this note thank you
for watching we'll see you tomorrow
revolution
heat heat
greeting you with aloha and namaste
i i love india presence uh occupation of
a territory by another country pertains
to india what we saw in kashmir and the
prime minister modi
how do you see trump's america yes the
current administration behaves
differently from the previous
administration
are you saying that there are foreign
powers who are trying to bring down the
current government in syria exactly iran
maybe
russia alternative
prime minister modi committed to south
you know cooperations
for not over 50% is ukraine prepared to
pay the price for that peace no
compromises at the cost of territorial
integrity and sovereignty
