Hello and welcome to Vantage. This week,
a show where we recap the highlights of
the week gone by. Donald Trump has
imposed sweeping global tariffs. He has
effectively unleashed a global trade
war. So what should you know about his
tariff moves? How do they impact India
and the world? How are the markets
reacting? We'll discuss all of that. In
Russia, Vladimir Putin is ramping up his
military. He has launched a new
recruitment drive to draft 160,000 men
into the army. What's behind this
massive buildup? We will tell you and
discuss why the Netflix series
Adolesence has sparked a global
conversation. All this and more lined
up. Let's get started.
They charge us, we charge them, we
charge them less. So how could anybody
be upset? We're going to fight these
tariffs. This is not the act of a
friend. The global economy will
massively suffer.
[Music]
tariffs. One of the many things you
learned in school. You may remember
reading about it in your textbook. Some
of you may have thought, "Why bother?
It's not like I'll ever I'll ever use it
in
life." Well, now we know how wrong we
were. Tariffs will probably be the word
of the year and if Donald Trump has his
way, maybe even the word of the decade.
Yesterday was his big liberation tariff
day. President Trump held a special
event at the White House. The stage was
decked in American flags and Trump
walked out to a big round of applause
and
music. Then came the big speech. Trump
spoke for almost one hour. He brought in
charts. He made false accusations at
countries and he promised liberation for
Americans. China. For decades, our
country has been looted, pillaged,
raped, and plundered by nations near and
far, both friend and foe alike. They
watched in anguish as foreign leaders
have stolen our jobs. Foreign cheaters
have ransacked our factories, and
foreign scavengers have torn apart our
once beautiful American dream. Our
country and its taxpayers have been
ripped off for more than 50 years, but
it is not going to happen anymore. It's
not going to happen.
After the speech, Trump signed an
executive order. With one stroke, the
pen, he ripped up the global trading
order. He effectively started a global
trade war. And at the center of it are
reciprocal tariffs. We have explained
this before. These are basically tit
fortat tariffs. You impose 10%, I will
impose 10%. That is the definition of
reciprocal tariffs. But Trump's version
is a bit different. Tonight we'll tell
you about this tariff regime. In fact,
we've split it into 10 parts. The 10
things that you must know about this
move. Number one, Trump has not gone for
full
reciprocity, which is a deviation from
his original plan. Initially, he wanted
to go beyond reciprocity. He said he
won't just look at tariff rates. He will
also look at non-tariff barriers like
subsidies or tax
cuts. That approach would have been even
more devastating. But as it turned out,
Trump did not go that way. The current
rates are less than reciprocal. He has
called it kind tariffs.
I call this kind reciprocal. This is not
full reciprocal. This is kind
reciprocal. But what we do is we cut it
in half. We charge them.
So what are these kind rates? That's our
second highlight. Trump has unveiled a
10% baseline tariff. This will apply to
all goods entering the United States.
Basically a blanket
tariff and this will come into effect on
Saturday. For some countries, this is
also the only rate like the United
Kingdom, Brazil, Singapore, Australia,
the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi
Arabia. Trump says these countries
charge American goods 10% tariff. So the
reciprocal rate is also 10%. Meaning
only the baseline applies to these
countries, the ones that I just
mentioned, which brings us to the third
highlight. Around 60 countries face
customized tariff rates. These are over
and above the 10%. I'll quickly go
through some of them. The White House
says China's tariffs
are 67%. The reciprocal rate is 34%.
Remember, China already faces 25% US
tariffs. So, the total comes to over
50%. The White House claims that Europe
imposes 39%
tariffs and the reciprocal is 20%. For
Japan, it is 24%. For India it is 27%
for Israel 17% for Pakistan
30% for South Africa 31% South Korea 26%
and Taiwan 32%. These are the tariffs on
major countries. They will be imposed on
the 9th of April. That's next
Wednesday. Trump channeled his reality
TV persona while announcing them. With a
chart in hand, he rattled out the rates.
China 67%, European Union 39%, Vietnam
90%, Taiwan 64%, we're going to charge
them 32%, Japan 46%, they would charge
us 46%. India very very tough, very very
tough. They charge us 52%, Switzerland
61% to 31%, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Cambodia, oh look at Cambodia 97%. The
United Kingdom 10%. South Africa. Oh,
60%, 30%.
Next is highlight number four. Trump
announced a special rate for foreign
automobiles, a 25%
tariff. Say you're importing a car made
in Germany or China or France. Then the
importers must pay 25% tariff. This
applies to cars made anywhere in the
world. And this tariff came into effect
this morning.
I know we've thrown a lot of numbers at
you, but how did Trump arrive at these
numbers? Well, that is highlight number
five. The White House is talking about a
very complicated formula, but some
mathematicians have figured it out.
First, they took a country's trade
surplus with America. Then they divided
it by their exports to America and the
result was then
halved. Let's look at the example of
China. China's trade surplus is
$295 billion. Their exports to the US
are $438 billion. If you divide that,
you get
0.67. 67% is how the Americans
calculated it. If you have that and
round it up, you get 34%. Which is what
Trump is now imposing on China.
Economists are baffled by this
calculation. They're calling it sixth
grade maths.
But some countries don't have to make
these calculations. The likes of Iran,
North Korea and Russia because Trump is
not imposing tariffs on them. Iran,
North Korea, and Russia, no tariffs. And
that is highlight number six. These
countries are already under significant
US sanctions. Their tariff rates are
also quite high. So the White House says
additional tariffs are not
necessary. Besides them, the tariffs are
comprehensive, perhaps too
comprehensive, which is our seventh
highlight. Trump has even targeted
remote islands like Herd Island and
Macdonald
Island. These are technically part of
Australia, but Trump has imposed a
separate 10% tariff on them. Guess how
much this island exports? Nothing.
Because no one lives there. Trump will
have to ask penguins to cuff up the
money. Another example is Norolk Island.
This is yet another Australian overseas
territory. has been slapped with 29%
tariffs. That's actually 19 points more
than the tariffs on
Australia. And how many people live
there? Just 2,000. Even Australia's
prime minister is scratching his head.
Norfolk Island um interestingly is I
think 29%.
Um, I'm not sure what Norfolk Island
major exports are to uh to the United
States and why it's been singled out,
but it has.
Remember Lysotu? Trump claimed that
nobody had heard of this country. Yet,
he's slapping them with 50% tariffs 50,
which makes you wonder what is the logic
here. Thankfully, certain goods are
exempt from these tariffs. And that is
highlight number eight. There will be no
extra tariffs on pharmaceuticals, also
on copper, semiconductors, gold and
energy. Basically, all things strategic,
no tariffs on them. Next is highlight
number nine. Yesterday's roll out had a
lot of logistical errors. It did not
live up to the liberation hype and I'll
tell you why. Trump's chart showed
India's tariffs at
26%. But then the White House said it
was 27%. A couple of other countries
also had such discrepancies. Plus, look
at
Taiwan. It is listed under a table
called countries. Even though the US
does not recognize Taiwan's
independence, if intentional, this is a
bold statement, but chances are it's a
mistake. And finally, the 10th
highlight. How are markets reacting to
Trump's liberation day? Not well.
Japan's Nikai lost almost 1,000 points
today.
It fell to an 8-month low. In India, the
Sensex lost more than 320 points. In
France, the CAC fell almost 240%. In
Germany, the DAX fell more than 600
points. In Hong Kong, the Hangen dropped
350 plus points. And as expected, it is
worse in America. The S&P 500 was down
225 points in opening trade and Dow
Jones almost 1,500 points down.
Everywhere you look, stocks are in the
red. And this is just the start. Once
the retaliation comes, the blood bath
may
worsen. Very, very tough. Very, very
tough.
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
So, Donald Trump's trade war is well and
truly underway. He has spared no one
this time, not even
India. Some observers had different
expectations. They believed that India
would be left out because both sides are
negotiating a trade agreement. India and
the US, they've been talking about a
trade deal. Trump himself said this a
few days ago. So the hope was that he
won't impose tariffs till those talks
conclude. But that's not how it played
out. Listen to this. India very very
tough. Very very tough. The prime
minister just left and he's a great
friend of mine. But I said you're a
friend of mine but you're not be
treating us right. They charge us 52%.
You have to understand we charge him
almost nothing for
India is very tough. He said he called
Prime Minister Modi a great friend but
he imposed tariffs nonetheless. They
will come into effect on the 9th of
April. And what's the rate?
27%. Although Trump's chart as we just
told you said 26%. The official order of
the US government says 27% and that
chart had many such discrepancies. But
for the moment we'll focus on India.
What will be the impact of these tariffs
on India? How much would it cost the
Indian economy?
$34
billion. That's the cost. That's almost
1% of India's GDP. $34 billion. 1% of
India's GDP. 0.9% to be precise. And
which industries and sectors will be
hit? We have a list. Electronics worth
$14
billion. Gems and jewelry worth $9
billion. and automobiles and auto
parts they will be charged a different
rate though Trump has announced a
blanket 25% tax on on automobiles and
auto parts that's for all countries so
the same 25% rate would apply to India
too this is only for auto exports 25%
tariffs and auto exports in India's case
is not a substantial amount India does
not export a lot of finished automobiles
to the US but it supply auto parts and
this export is worth $2.2 billion. So
broadly these are the industries that
will be hit. Now let's talk about the
ones that are safe. Pharmaceuticals,
semiconductors and copper, steel and
energy products. All these have been
spared from the new Trump tariff
regime. And what is India's response?
The commerce ministry has issued a
statement. It said New Delhi is and I'm
quoting carefully examining the tariffs.
It plans to take feedback from the
industry. There is one line that stands
out in the statement. Let me quote. The
department is also studying the
opportunities that may arise due to this
new
development. Now, the use of the word
opportunities is
interesting. How can India benefit from
Trump's trade war? Is there a silver
lining? Experts say there is. Look
around the region. Other players have
been slapped with far steeper tariffs
like China. Effectively, Chinese
products will face 54% tariffs. That's
the highest among all US trade partners.
Vietnam comes next with 46% tariffs
overall. Then you have Bangladesh at
37%. For India, the tariff is 27%. It's
still a blow, but it could have been
worse. And this gap between India and
its neighbors may work in India's favor,
specifically in three high value
industries, textiles, electronics, and
machinery. Experts say that Trump's
tariffs can open new doors for India.
One example they give is that of Taiwan.
It's the world the world leader in
semiconductor supply. But if the supply
chain shift from Taiwan and if India
emerges as an
alternative, if it replaces Taiwan even
partially, it would be a boost for
India's
economy. All of these are big ifs, but
there's a possibility. New Delhi can
start with some lowhanging fruits stuff
like packaging, testing, and low-end
chip manufacturing. So that's one
scenario to harness the impending supply
disruption. Similarly, India has
opportunities in areas like machinery
and toys. China currently dominates the
space, but with tariffs as high as 54%,
businesses will look elsewhere to make
their goods to cut costs and maintain
their bottom line. So, India is in a
strong position. But to leverage this,
India must
reform. India must position itself to
win new businesses. It must make
structural reforms and offer compelling
incentives to invite businesses. This
includes building infrastructure and
strengthening the logistics network.
There's a lot of work to do. Trump's
tariffs could push India towards making
these changes. At the same time, India
will have to manage Trump's
unpredictability. Which brings us to the
trade deal. The US wants India to make
sweeping concessions. It wants to it
wants India to reduce tariffs across the
board from energy to defense and even
agriculture. Now if India agrees to
American terms, it could still evade the
tariffs. But the price for this would be
steep. If you lower the barriers on
American goods, Indian manufacturers
could lose out. If tariffs on farm
products are reduced, Indian farmers
would
protest. And this is tricky both
economically and politically. So New
Delhi will have to strike a tough
balance. Our next story is for the
American consumer. You're in for pain.
Prices will go up. Whatever you plan to
buy, a pack of avocados, a can of beer,
a new car, your bill will be higher than
before thanks to your president and his
tariffs.
Well, his logic is simple and skewed. He
wants to cut the reliance on foreign
goods to bring jobs back to America and
to make it great again. April 2nd, 2025
will forever be remembered as the day
American industry was reborn, the day
America's destiny was reclaimed, and the
day that we began to make America
wealthy.
So tariffs have a patriotic packaging
and like most packaged stuff there's
more gas than substance because tariffs
will make imported goods costlier and
that extra money will come from American
wallets. This is how it works. Say an
American company buys beer from Mexico
or car parts from Canada. Now they have
tariffs. So this company will have to
pay extra and the company will not eat
the cost. it will pass it on to the
consumers and things will get expensive.
In fact, we have a list of what will be
the worst hit. The first is houses.
Housing is the biggest purchase for most
American households. 94% of American
houses are made of lumber and the US
imports onethird of its lumber from
Canada. Now, with tariffs in place,
lumber prices will go up and by
extension, prices of houses will go up,
too. Second is cars. Trump has announced
25% auto tariffs on cars and car parts
and this came into effect today. Trump
believes it will revive the US auto
industry. But such horrendous imbalances
have devastated our industrial base and
put our national security at risk. I
don't blame these other countries at all
for this calamity. I blame former
presidents and past leaders who weren't
doing their job. They let it happen and
they let it happen to an extent that
nobody can even believe.
But will it really will it help the US
auto industry? Cars are the second
largest purchase for most Americans. In
2024, the US imported around 8 million
cars. That is around $240 billion in
trade. It makes for nearly half of the
sales. Most of these car makers rely
heavily on international supply chains,
mostly in North America. They produce
vehicles in Mexico and Canada. Car parts
are also manufactured
there. So, these new tariffs will affect
all of
it. We talking about goods worth
$460
billion. So, car prices will certainly
go up in the US anywhere between $4,000
to $10,000 per vehicle. That is what
economists
estimate. Then we have fuel prices.
America imports crude oil. More than 60%
of it is from Canada. It is the largest
foreign supplier of crude oil to the US.
So tariffs could push up fuel prices,
too. The fourth product that will get
expensive is alcohol. If you're a fan of
Modello or Corona, brace yourself,
Mexican beer will cost more because of
the new tariffs on beer and the aluminum
cans that they come in. Same for
bourbon, tequila, and Canadian whiskey.
Long story short, your weekend drinks
will burn a hole in your
pocket. The fifth on this list is daily
groceries like avocado and maple syrup.
Nearly 90% of US avocados come from
Mexico. 90%
So, your guacamole will get pricier.
There's also maple syrup. Canada
accounts for
75% of its global production. So, if you
want to save money, pancakes without
syrup is your new normal. Now, Trump
believes that these tariffs will boost
American companies. They will produce
everything domestically and people will
buy that stuff. Great idea on paper. But
here's the problem. US manufacturers are
not ready to meet the demand. It takes
years to build supply chains from
scratch. Until then, consumers pay the
price. And this is just the beginning.
Tariffs don't just stop at the grocery
store or the gas pump. They ripple
through the entire economy. Jobs get
cut, businesses slow down, exports
struggle as prices climb, wages often do
not keep up. All of this means inflation
will rise. And that has raised fears of
a recession. We should be very
concerned. The last time uh trade war on
this scale has happened was in 1930s uh
exactly 1930. It was smooth holly tariff
act and it led to a global recession
worldwide. Uh and if uh this trade war
escalates we could see a slowdown of the
global economy uh on the scale of a
global financial crisis of 2014 and
possibly deeper. And this is the largest
threat which would affect the whole
world.
Yesterday we told you about Goldman
Sachs. It raised the possibility of a US
recession to
35%. And now Barclays has flagged it
too. It says there's a high risk that
the US will enter recession. It is even
driving bets on prediction markets. More
than 50% are betting on the fact that
America will slip into a recession. So
the question is, is this short-term pain
for long-term gain or is it just pain
all the way? Will it bring jobs back to
the US or will America end up paying the
price literally? We'll be tracking this
for you.
[Music]
[Music]
We are uh looking at pharma right now
pharmaceuticals as a separate category
and we'll be announcing that sometime in
the near future not too distant future.
[Music]
It was just another Thursday until it
wasn't. The markets opened, they bled,
and by the closing bell, the top 500
companies lost around $2.5 trillion. 2.5
trillion. It's not because of a military
conflict. It's not because of oil or
even Silicon Valley drama. It's Trump's
tariff
announcement. That is what tanked the
stocks. It was a seismic sell-off for
the Magnificent 7. The tremors ran deep.
I'm talking about America's tech giants.
Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta,
Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Together,
they're called the Magnificent 7. It's
because of their dominance of the stock
market, these seven companies. But
yesterday, they stumbled. And how the
Magnificent 7 lost a combined total of
$1
trillion? 1 trillion wiped out wiped out
in a day. The worst hit was Apple. Apple
shared $310 billion in just one day and
it's because of how Apple
operates. About 80% of iPhones are
produced in China. India produces around
7% and Vietnam assembles 20%
iPads. Now, all of these nations have
been hit by high
tariffs and the math was brutal.
According to some estimates, Apple's
costs could go up by $40 billion every
single year. 40. The tariffs leave Apple
with a difficult choice. Option one,
pass on the higher costs and hope that
the consumers will not mind. Option two,
swallow the tariffs and see the profit
slump. Chances are they will choose
option
one and pass on the cost to the
consumer, which means iPhones will will
get even more expensive. Right now, the
iPhone 16 sells in the US for
$799. It could go up to
$1,142. The iPhone 16 Pro Max currently
sells for up to
$1,599, almost $1,600. That could rise
to almost
$2,300. A
$2300
phone. Will people even buy it? That's
what's worrying investors and that is
why Apple stocks are
slumping. Then there's Nvidia,
everyone's favorite chip maker. Its
chips are produced in Taiwan. The island
got slapped with a 32% tariff. But
here's the twist. Semiconductors
themselves are technically exempt from
the tariffs. There is no tariff on them
yet on semiconductors. But the stuff
they go into is not exempt. things like
your laptops, servers, gaming rigs.
These are not exempt from tariffs, which
is why Nvidia lost around $210
billion. The third big loser was Amazon.
Amazon is heavily dependent on Chinese
imports. It lost around $180 billion,
$180 billion. And it's the same issue
again. 20% of all Amazon goods come from
China. So the new tariffs will impact
the company. They will set it back by
millions of dollars every
year. But it wasn't just the magnificent
seven that bore the brunt. Retail
companies too are being closel lined
quite
literally. American retail has always
been a quiet symphony of foreign parts.
T-shirts from Bangladesh, zippers from
China, synthetic souls from Vietnam. It
functioned like a seamless orchestra.
But tariffs have turned it into
cacophony.
Take Nike for example. The company
relies on a vast global supply chain and
that is going to cost it. Nike makes
half of its shoes in Vietnam and China.
So your sneakers will get more
expensive. By how much? Estimates
suggest around $30 to $40 per
shoe. That's how much the price could
rise. Then there's the auto industry. As
we've been telling you, there's a 25%
tariff on cars and car parts. It is to
revive American manufacturing, but for
now it is bringing back layoffs. US car
maker Stellantis is laying off 900
people. It is at five of its American
facilities. It is also shutting down two
plants, one in Mexico and the other in
Canada. It's scary. And a lot of people
are scared of change, but I think
they're more scared of not knowing
what's going to
happen. Change is a little bit easier to
navigate. At least you know the
variables here. We don't know the
variables. That's the scary part.
Even airlines couldn't escape this blood
bath. United dropped by 16%. Delta fell
11% and Frontier took a 12% dive. You
may wonder why is that? Why are airlines
affected? That's because higher tariffs
make everything cost more. There's jet
fuel, imported parts, snacks, and
probably even those tiny airplane
pillows that no one uses.
All of it is going to cost more. So,
it's looking like a lost fight.
Thankfully, not everyone ended up face
down on the mat. For example, the pharma
industry. For now, they're exempt from
the
tariffs. There was some relief there,
but that ended with Trump's ominous
warning. Listen to this. Pharma is going
to be uh starting to come in, I think,
at a level that you haven't really seen
before.
We are uh looking at pharma right now.
Pharmaceuticals as a separate category
and we'll be announcing that sometime in
the near future, not too distant future.
That's under review right now.
So here's the thing. Tariffs are not
just taxes on imports. These are taxes
on how the modern economy works. We live
in the era of global supply chains. A
t-shirt might be designed in Los
Angeles, stitched in Cambodia, died in
Vietnam, and shipped via Singapore.
break that chain and you're not just
disrupting business, you are disrupting
globalization. And for many companies,
that means rebuilding supply chains from
scratch and that too at an enormous
cost. So Trump's tariffs are more than a
policy. They are a rejection of the
interconnected global economy. Some will
call it protectionism, others will call
it long overdue realism. But whatever
you call it, it has
teeth. And those teeth are leaving marks
on companies
worldwide. Most games have two parts.
First is your main mission and the
second is your side quests. President
Donald Trump already has a lot of main
missions like his liberation tariffs and
his peace pursuit in Ukraine. We've
talked a lot about his main missions. So
tonight we are talking about his side
quest and that is a nuclear deal with
Iran. Remember Trump himself walked out
of that deal in 2018, but now he wants
to sign a new one, presumably a better
one. But he's not asking Iran to begin
talks. He's threatening them. Let me
quote what he said last week. If they
don't make a deal, there will be
bombing. It will be bombing the likes of
which they have never seen before.
So Trump is threatening to bomb Iran.
And it's not just empty talk. The US has
moved B2 bomber planes to Diego
Garcia. Take a look at these satellite
pictures. You can see at least six B2
bombers. These can carry the heaviest
American bombs and nukes. Weapons that
can strike targets deep underground.
Targets like Iranian nuclear sides. And
now look at the location. Diego Garcia
is a joint USUK base in the Indian
Ocean. It's around 3,900 kilometers from
Iran. Trump is also moving warships to
this region. One aircraft carrier is
already in West Asia. That's the USS the
USS Harry S. Truman. Now Trump is
sending a second carrier, the USS Carl
Vincson. That's a lot of air and
maritime power near Iran. So clearly
Donald Trump is sending a message. come
to the talking table or prepare for the
worst. And how is Iran responding? Their
supreme leader gave a speech on Monday.
He vowed to hit back in kind.
The enmity from the US and Israel has
always been there. They threatened to
attack us, which we don't think is very
probable. But if they commit any
mischief, they will surely receive a
strong reciprocal blow.
Does that mean no talks? Well, not
necessarily. Iran's president says he is
ready for indirect talks, but he will
not engage directly with the United
States. He wants a middleman. And who
will that be? Russia is keen to play
that role to mediate between Iran and
the US. But Moscow is not a fan of
Trump's threats. They say targeting
Iran's nuclear sites would be
catastrophic, not to mention
counterproductive. Iran is already in a
vulnerable state. Its economy is
struggling. Its ally in Syria has been
toppled. Its proxies in Gaza, Yemen, and
Lebanon have been weakened. So, how do
you think they would respond to a direct
attack? By lashing out. A top Iranian
official made that clear. He said, "If
you attack us, we will build a nuclear
bomb.
We have said that there is a fatwa. We
are working under the supervision of the
IAEA and we won't move toward a nuclear
weapon. But if you make a mistake
regarding Iran's nuclear issue, you'll
force Iran to take that path because it
has to defend itself.
How close is Iran to making a bomb? They
could produce weapons grade uranium in
two weeks. After that, it's just a
matter of months. So, Iran is very close
to making a nuclear bomb, which is why
Donald Trump is suddenly keen on a
deal. Iran too is open to restarting
talks, but they have certain concerns.
For starters, Iran wants the US to lift
sanctions. Only then will they engage in
direct talks.
Secondly, there is a trust
deficit. Iran went through all of this
with Barack Obama when he was president.
Iran signed a nuclear deal and they kept
their end of the agreement. It was
America that walked out under Donald
Trump. So naturally, the Iranians are a
bit apprehensive. They feel that Trump
cannot be trusted. The question is, how
do you break this deadlock? You need a
trusted mediator, someone who Trump and
the Iranians can rely on. Like I said,
Russia is eyeing that role, but it's not
clear if they have the bandwidth. After
all, Moscow has its own peace talks with
Ukraine. Another option is China.
Beijing has offered to play a
constructive role, but their sympathies
clearly lie with
Iran. The implementation of the joint
comprehensive plan of action has been
disrupted by US
withdrawal. The United States should
show political sincerity and return to
the talks as soon as possible.
sanctions, pressure, and coercion will
lead to
nowhere. Arab countries are also prime
candidates like the UAE or Oman. They're
also well placed to mediate the talks.
Whoever steps up, one thing is clear.
This is a great opportunity to revive
the nuclear deal. Trump recognizes the
importance of such an agreement. It
would unlock millions of barrels of oil.
It would free up West Asian shipping
lanes and it would deescalate regional
tensions. At the same time, it would
mean prosperity for Iranians because any
deal will involve the lifting of
sanctions, which is why Thran is also
not ruling out the talks. They simply
want asurances and concessions, which is
only fair after Trump's withdrawal in
2018. Let's hope both sides can put the
past behind them and make some progress.
Let's turn to Ukraine now, which is
bracing for a new onslaught. They have
steadily lost territory since this year
began, but chances are it could get
worse because President Putin is going
for the jugular. He has launched a new
recruitment drive today. The plan is to
draft 160,000 men into the Russian army.
Another 1 lakh 60,000 men to join the
army. Now, this is a massive buildup. It
is Russia's biggest conscription since
2011. All Russian men between the age of
18 and 30 can be drafted. They will have
to serve for one year. And where will
they serve? Typically away from the
front line because Russia leaves the
fighting to train soldiers. So these new
recruits are mostly backups.
Nonetheless, the timing is very
significant. The US and Ukraine are
trying to force Putin into a ceasefire.
And what does Putin do? He announces a
massive military recruitment drive. It's
a very clear message for Moscow.
Pressure will not work. A message from
Moscow rather, that pressure will not
work. The war will only end on Putin's
terms. But President Donald Trump is
still hopeful. He says Putin will live
up to his promise. I think he's going to
live up to what he told me and I think
he's going to
uh fulfill his uh part of the deal. Now
then you have Zalinski and hopefully
he's going to live up. I I see he's
trying to renegotiate the rare earth
and what about Ukraine? President
Zilinski predicted this last week. He
said Russia was planning new operations
in Sunumi, in Kharkiv, and in Japia. He
said Putin's plan is to drag out the
peace talks to gain as much land as
possible. European countries also share
this assessment. Their top diplomats met
in Madrid yesterday. They were joined by
the UK's foreign minister and all of
them had two demands. One, if Russia is
serious about peace, it should accept a
ceasefire and two, the US must put
pressure on Russia.
A few weeks ago, Ukraine agreed on an
unconditional ceasefire whilst Russia
keeps perpetrating war crimes. And I say
this on the third anniversary of the Bha
massacre. And I believe Russia today
owes the United States of America, who
have committed to reaching a ceasefire,
a clear answer on whether it wants to go
on the path of peace path, yes or no.
So Europe is calling out Russia. They
are saying, "Give us a clear answer. Do
you want a ceasefire or not?" Well,
Putin already gave his response last
month. It wasn't a yes or a no. It was a
maybe. You see, Russia has all the
battlefield advantage at the moment, and
they will want the truth to reflect
that, to give them
concessions. But Ukraine and Europe are
unwilling to accept that. They want to
give guarantees and recover lost
Ukrainian land, both of which are
non-starters for
Moscow. So, how can we break this
deadlock? Trump is trying from his end,
but could there be pressure from another
end? Perhaps from China? I ask because
the Chinese foreign minister is in
Moscow, Wongi. He's on a three-day trip
to Mo to to to Russia and he had held
two key meetings
today. First with Russian foreign
minister Sergey Lavrov and then with
President Putin in Moscow. Wongi spoke
to the Russian media. He talked about
the ongoing peace talks. Let me quote
from what he said. The step towards
peace, although not that big, is
constructive. It's worth building on it.
With peace, it is no pain, no
gain. You need to work hard to achieve
it. Now, this is this has largely been
China's position. Yes, we need peace in
Ukraine, but we must acknowledge
Russia's concerns, which is exactly what
Trump is doing. But will President Xi go
that extra mile? Will he ask Putin to
take a
ceasefire? Trump was certainly hopeful
of it. He admitted that China has a
great deal of influence over Putin. He
also urged Beijing to persuade Moscow.
Listen to this. Hopefully China can help
us stop the war with in particular
Russia Ukraine. They have a great deal
of power over that situation and uh
we'll work with them and I mentioned
that with during our phone conversation
with President Xi and hopefully we could
work together and get that stopped.
Does China have the leverage? Their
trade with Russia stands at
$224 billion dollars. China is Russia's
largest trading partner. It has been for
14 years now. Plus, China gives a lot of
dual use goods to Russia. Dual use goods
are things that have both military and
civilian use. So, in short, yes, China
does have the leverage. But does it also
have the political
will? This question is a lot tougher to
answer. If China can persuade Putin,
they will have Donald Trump's
gratitude, it's worth a lot right now
because Trump has launched a trade war
with China. So Beijing would love a
change in fortunes to be in Trump's good
books. Having said that, there is a
downside too. If this war ends,
US-Russia ties will improve considerably
and Trump has been quite open about
this. He wants to deepen relations with
Moscow. At the same time, he wants to
break up the Russia China axis.
So, it's a tough call for Beijing. Yes,
they would like to see the war end. It
would open up supply chains and energy
markets, but do they have sufficient
confidence in their ties with Moscow?
Can it survive Trump's reset with
Russia? In today's meeting, Wongi
projected confidence. He said China and
Russia would not tolerate inter
interference from outside. He said their
ties are not against a third country.
Let's see if this confidence allows
Beijing to push Vladimir
[Music]
Putin in terms of dollars. $3 billion,
$533 million.
[Music]
[Applause]
I want to
[Music]
say there's an old playbook for new
American presidents, especially when it
comes to their first big foreign trip.
You shake hands in London, maybe share a
polite chuckle with Canada, or pay a
visit to Mexico City. Most American
presidents have followed this, but not
Donald Trump. He first became president
in the year 2017 and tossed this
playbook out the window. Trump's first
foreign trip as president was to Saudi
Arabia, and now he's in the White House
again for a second term. Guess where
he's heading first? Back to Saudi
Arabia. Reports suggest that Trump will
visit the kingdom in the month of May.
That will be his first foreign trip as
US
president. Which brings us to the
question, why Saudi Arabia? Why does
Trump keep going there
first? And what does he hope to
achieve? Let's start with the last one.
What does he hope to achieve? If there's
one thing that Trump loves, it's a big
flashy deal. That's what he got in 2017.
He landed in Saudi Arabia. He got a
grand reception and he secured a $450
billion investment. Tremendous day. I
just want to thank everybody. But
tremendous investments in to the United
States and our military
uh community is very happy and we want
to thank you and Saudi Arabia. But uh
hundreds of billions of dollars of
investments into the United States and
jobs, jobs, jobs.
This time he's outdoing himself. Riyad
has pledged to invest $600 billion in
the US. $600 billion. But Trump is not
happy. He wants a trillion dollars. 1
trillion. That's one with 12 zeros. And
that's what Trump hopes to achieve on
this
trip. Of course, when and how this this
money flows is a is an entirely
different
story. But this is not just about the
money. It's the way Trump does
business. He doesn't like slow
bureaucratic diplomacy. He likes big
numbers, catchy headlines, and immediate
results. In 2018, Saudi Crown Prince
Muhammad bin Salman was in the White
House, and Donald Trump came with a
chart for their protection. It showed
the American weapons sales to Saudi
Arabia to Saudi Arabia very soon, and
that's for their protection. But if you
look in terms of dollars, $3 billion,
$533 million,
$525 million, that's peanuts for you.
This is Trump's style and you could say
it aligns with the Saudi royal family.
They don't bother with stiff formality
or cautious maneuvering. They go over
the top and that's what they did with
Donald Trump. Riyad rolled out the red
carpet for him. They made him feel like
a king with their gold-plated
receptions, their lavish banquetss, and
their sword
dances. So, Trump got his multi-billion
dollar deals, and Saudi Arabia got
political support. That's how they
played it the last time, and they seem
to be gearing up for round two. Now, to
be fair, Trump is not the first US
president to cozy up to the Saudis.
Washington has been cutting deals with
Riyad since the
1940s. Roosevelt struck a pact, oil for
security. Saudi oil for American
security. That was the deal. The deal
that shaped West Asian politics for
decades. Presidents Carter, Reagan,
Bush, Obama, they all played this game.
But things hit a rough patch with Joe
Biden. He started on a bad note with the
Saudi royals and he could never really
mend the
ties. Now Biden is out. Donald Trump is
back in office. He wants to take it to
the next level.
Unlike his predecessors, Trump's Saudi
connection is not just political. It is
very personal. The Saudis bailed out
Trump's son-in-law. His name is Jared
Kushner. He was a big shot in Trump's
first term. He has kept a low profile
this time. The Saudis gave Jared Kushner
a lifeline of $2
billion. Plus, they have strong business
ties, the Trump Organization and the
Saudis. In 2024, they announced their
second tower in
Riyad. And then there's Trump's favorite
sport, golf. Donald Trump has strong
ties with Live Golf. That's the golf
tour backed by the Saudi Sovereign Fund.
Trump has praised it multiple times. In
2023, Live Golf announced a merger with
the US-based PGA Tour. The deal is yet
to be closed, but Trump is doing his
best to secure it. So, as you can see,
Trump's ties are more than political.
They're very much financial and
personal. Take the Jamal Kashog episode.
He was a Saudi dissident. He was killed
in the Saudi embassy in Turkey,
reportedly on the orders of the Saudi
crown prince. When the case came to
light, every western nation isolated the
Saudi kingdom, but not Donald Trump. We
are going to leave nothing uncovered.
With that being said, the king firmly
denied any knowledge of it. He didn't
really know. Maybe I I don't want to get
into his mind, but it sounded to me like
maybe these could have been rogue
killers. Who knows?
There's also the war in Ukraine. Trump
wants to end it. And helping him in this
pursuit is Saudi Arabia. They're playing
the role of mediator. All big meetings
between the Americans, the Russians, and
the Ukrainians are being held in Riyad.
And this says a lot about the
relationship. Trump loves the Saudi
kingdom.
But what's the agenda for this
visit? He's looking at the next big
prize. Not just the money. He also wants
a normalization deal between Saudi
Arabia and Israel. These two countries
do not recognize each other. They have
no official diplomatic ties. If Trump
can change that, he would change West
Asia forever. And it's a deal that he
has long pursued. In his last term, he
got four Arab states to recognize
Israel. the UA, Bahrain, Morocco, and
Sudan. Adding Saudi Arabia appeared to
be just a matter of time, but that was
during the last term. Right now, the
picture is very different. West Asia is
a mess. The war in Gaza is raging. The
Saudis want a clear path to Palestinian
statethood. They cannot be seen as
abandoning Gaza after all that has
happened in the last
year. So, normalization with Israel
right now would be very tough. Of
course, Saudi Arabia would also want
something in return. And that's
literally the trillion dollar question.
What does Riyad want? Maybe more
military support, maybe advanced
weapons, maybe even nuclear
technology. We shall find out soon
enough. I'm sure you're familiar with
Jordan. It's a country in West Asia,
home to more than 11 million people.
Jordan also has a standing army of more
than 100,000
soldiers. I know what you're thinking.
Why this crash course on Jordan? Well,
Jordan's GDP is just above $50 billion,
which is less than what our story's main
character is worth. I'm talking about
America's Harvard University. It is
worth 53
billion. 53 billion. That's more than
the GDP of 120 countries.
Every year, Harvard's pile keeps
growing, but President Donald Trump
could be putting a stop to it. He is
reviewing government funding to Harvard.
How much money are we talking about
here? Around $9
billion. That's 8 $8.7 billion in grants
and around $255 million in contracts.
Harvard University was supposed to get
this money over the next couple of
years, but Donald Trump has paused it.
Why? because of Howard's response to
Gaza protests. Trump says the university
did not crack down on
anti-semitism that Jewish students were
targeted by protesters, hence the
decision to review the
funding. Trump did the same to Colombia
University as well. He withheld $400
million in federal funding. Next thing
you know, Colombia changed its policy.
Now, we'll stay away from the politics
for now. Instead, we'll focus on the
money. How did Harvard University end up
with $53
billion? Why did it need another $9
billion? And where will this money go?
Where does this money go? When we say
Harvard has 53 billion, we're talking
about the Harvard endowment. Think of it
as a funding pool. Every donation in the
university's history, every gift, every
check, all of it goes to this endowment.
Harvard then invests this money in
different places like in stocks, private
equity or hedge
funds and the returns well that is used
to run the colleges. These returns make
up onethird of Harvard's expenses. What
about the rest? Well, that comes from
other sources like federal funding and
tuition
fees. Look at last year's split.
Harvard's total expenses came to $6.4
billion. Out of this 2.4 4 billion came
from the endowment and the rest from
grants and fees. So let me recap.
Harvard University is sitting on $53
billion. It is making billions from this
fund every year. Yet it was slated to
receive $9 billion
more. 9 billion of American taxpayers
money. Where exactly does it go? One
expense is financial aid. Harvard has
almost 25,000 students.
around 55% of them get some sort of
financial assistance. Another expense is
salaries. This university has more than
20,000 faculty and staff. They're some
of the best in the world, which means
they're highly
paid. Then you have upkeep and capital
expenses. Harvard has multiple
buildings, libraries, and museums. It
also sits on a massive parcel of land,
almost 5,000 acres in size. So clearly,
maintenance will be expensive. And
finally we have research. Harvard
conducts dozens of studies and
experiments every year. They cover
fields like medicine and technology. And
this is where federal funding comes in.
So the US government wants to study, say
the US government wants to study certain
diseases or to weaponize certain
technology which they do all the time.
Then they will ask Harvard to carry out
the research. In return the university
gets money. Last year, the US government
paid Harvard
$686 million. Nearly 500 million came
from just one agency, the National
Institutes of Health,
NIH, and over $50 million came from the
Pentagon, the American Defense Ministry.
Obviously, a lot of this money is used
for the actual research to buy machines
and to pay researchers. But sometimes
the money is also
misused. That's what happened at
Stanford in 1991. government money was
used to repair the sailing team's
yacht. It was even used to upgrade the
university president's closet and pay
for his laundry. It tells you what the
downside is. Yes, the money contributes
to cutting edge research, but the
oversight is lacking. And that's just
one problem here. The sheer size of this
funding is also problematic. $9 billion
is a lot of money. Fun fact, it is equal
to all of Afghanistan's central bank
assets. assets that are frozen in
America. How can such a bloated budget
be justified, especially in a country
like the US? Around twothirds of
American adults do not have a college
degree. Almost 42 million Americans have
student debt. 42 million. Yet the
government is giving billions to elite
colleges. Colleges that are
unthinkable for most
Americans. How can this be justified?
Supporters say Harvard has a multiplier
effect. Say you spend $1 on research,
that research could lead to medical or
technological breakthroughs, thus saving
many more lives and dollars. So
supporters say it's worth it, but
critics say it's not. They want this
money to be spent more widely on
schools, on student loans, and on
community
colleges. The fact is, US college
funding did need a review. If not for
anti-semitism, then certainly for
wasteful
spending, attention to detail, intricate
hand drawings, and a slow, yearslong,
careful process. This is what many
animated movies usually entail, like the
ones from the famed Studio Gibli. But
last week, all of it changed. OpenAI
launched its advanced AI image
generator, and you all know what
happened next. Users quickly began using
it. They rendered image after image.
They turned everything from memes to
selfies into copies of the Japanese
studios work. And they flooded social
media with Giblly style images. This
spurred a global outage of chat GPT over
the weekend and forced its top boss to
say, "Please chill. This is
insane." Critics agree indeed it is
because this viral imitation trend
raises a range of
concerns. moral and legal ones and more
importantly privacy concerns. Tonight
we'll talk about that last bit. Your
data's privacy. Experts say that it may
have gone for a toss
here. Let us understand why. Open AAI
has a privacy policy. It clearly states
that the company collects the data that
users feed it. Then it uses this data to
train its AI models. So when you
voluntarily upload your original
personal images on chat GPT, you expose
facial data via
pictures. You give OpenAI consent to
process those images. Your family
photos, pictures of your home, pictures
of your children, whatever it is that
you have uploaded. Open AAI has free and
easy access to all the pictures that you
have voluntarily shared with it. Safe to
say this is a serious safety concern. So
experts are sounding an alarm. They say
that the free-for-all Giblly cuteness
may come at a cost. Tech giants train
their models without disclosing details.
And this tech itself is new. So, who
knows what AI training involves exactly?
Your photo could be misused. It could be
manipulated. It could be sold for
targeted ads. If the data is stolen, it
could even end up on the dark web. And
if this sounds scary, that's because it
is. None of these risks are
unprecedented.
Have you heard of Clear View
AI? This is an American startup. It
deals with facial recognition. Last
year, it was fined $33 million by a
Dutch watchdog. The company was scraping
billions of images from social media
without people's
consent. Compiling them into a database
and then selling them. Similarly, last
year an Australian company called Outer
Box suffered a data breach. It had
facial scans, driving licenses,
addresses of a million people. All this
data was
stolen. Like I said, it is scary. And
this is not just about your pictures. It
is about all kinds of
data, like your health data. Let's look
at another tech giant, Apple. Apple is
revamping its health app. It wants to
analyze your health metrics, your heart
rate, blood oxygen, calories, all of it.
and it wants to give you live health
advice with an AI tool. This will
basically give you a doctor in your
pocket and it will give Apple a treasure
trove of data. Now, don't get us wrong,
this can be helpful in some cases, but
it comes at a time when headline after
headline shows this. Companies are
collecting your health data and selling
it sometimes secretly, sometimes openly,
but they're doing it. I have another
example, 23 and me. This is another big
name in the news for all the wrong
reasons. This is a genetic testing
service. People used it in hopes of
learning fun things about their family.
But now this company has gone under. It
is up for sale. And so is the DNA. The
DNA information, the genetic data, the
health histories, all of it 15 million
customers. All this data is up for grabs
to the highest bidder. So people are
scrambling to delete it and they're
crashing the site in the
process which brings this cautionary
tale to a full circle because this is
about everything from Gibli style images
to your DNA. Technology is growing by
leaps and bounds. It is monitoring us.
It is recording all kinds of data. It is
encoding and decoding our faces, our
feelings, our form. But what happens to
this data? Is it really used for the
better? Is it safe?
Frankly, no one is sure and that is a
huge problem. So, what should you
do? We have the answer straight from the
horse's mouth. We asked Chad GPT, "Is it
safe to upload personal pictures in Chad
GPT's Gibli art generator and listen to
what it said?" It is important to be
cautious. Avoid uploading sensitive or
personal content, identifiable or
private images. Review the privacy
policies of the service. And if you have
any concerns, it's always a good idea to
er on the side of
caution. We live in a world that looks
very different for kids today than it
did for their parents. This month, the
hit Netflix series Adolescence captured
this very difference. If you have
watched the show, you know what I'm
talking about. If you haven't, let me
give you a preview. In one episode, a
detective is investigating why a
13-year-old boy killed his female
classmate. He tracks their Instagram
interactions. Based on it, he assumes
that these two children were
friendly. That is, until his son, who's
a teenager himself, tells the detective
that he's got it all wrong. The emoji
shared between the teenagers seemed
innocuous, but they were actually a
coded form of
bullying. This is a dizzying realization
for the detective and for the viewers of
the series, and this disconnect is
central to
adolescence. This is a hard-hitting
drama. I chose the aftermath of the
stabbing of a teenage girl in the UK. It
shines light on the corrosive impact of
social media. It explores how the ideas
of online influencers like the
self-described misogynist Andrew Tate
shaped the views of children hooked onto
their
phones. It also talks about the impact
of the so-called
manosphere. This includes online forums
that oppose feminism and promote
sexism. So, the show explores a range of
interconnected issues and it has gripped
the world. It has attracted 66 million
viewers. the world
over. That's about the population of
France. Within its first week of
release, Adolesence made history in the
UK with about 6.5 million viewers. The
series has sparked a global
conversation. Even the British Prime
Minister is talking about it.
I mean, it's incredible. Um, and it
holds you there uh for four, um, frankly
at times harrowing episodes. Uh, and I
have to be honest, um, as a dad, I have
not found it easy viewing. We've been
watching it with our children. Um, my
girl is 14, my boy is 16. Um, and it's
been really hard to watch. It may be
hard to watch, but Netflix has made an
announcement. The drama will be aired
across schools in the UK. Children in
secondary schools will be able to watch
it for free. And Starama has backed this
decision. After all, adolesence is not
about one fictional innocent looking boy
who was driven to do something horrific.
It shows that what happened in this
series could happen anywhere is
happening anywhere and everywhere. Here
are some headlines from last year. A
17-year-old stabbed three little girls
dead at a dance class in the
UK. Two teenage boys were stabbed to
death and the murderer gloated about it
on social media.
Two 15year-olds were arrested for
killing a teenager by stabbing her 28
times. There are hundreds of cases like
these and not just in the UK from
Albania to India. It's happening
everywhere. The question is why? And the
answer is not
straightforward. But part of the problem
is isolation. Children are increasingly
becoming
lonely. About a third of them are lonely
the world over. Mental health cases are
on the rise. So children are no longer
safe in their own
rooms as they peer at
screens. Forces exploit their
vulnerability. The devastating effect of
misogyny on our society very powerful.
The dangers of online radicalization and
this sense of young people being on
their own very often in their bedroom or
wherever um isolated um with that online
radicalization.
Children are impressionable. What they
see is what they learn. Unfortunately,
in today's world, this means content on
the internet which is often hateful,
violent, and
sexist. According to a poll in the UK,
80% 80% of 16 and 17 year old boys
consume content by Andrew
Tate. In
contrast, only 60% have heard of their
own prime minister. This may sound
appalling, but 56% of young fathers
approve of Andrew Tate. Now, to give you
context, this is the same man who has
gone viral with his rants about male
dominance. He has openly advocated
violence against women. He has been
banned from every major social media
platform. And yet, his ideas have taken
root in the minds of countless children,
even boys as young as five.
So when impressions are made at such a
young age, we know what comes next. Deep
fake porn of girls made by their
classmates, cyber bullying, misogynistic
chants by children, and sexism across
schools spurred by social media. It is
like a horror show and children
everywhere are at
risk. But there is no silver bullet to
fix this. Like we said, this is not one
problem. This is a broad cultural issue.
It is about how society views women. It
is about the sheer lack of regulation.
It is about playing catch-up with
technology. This is a problem that needs
both awareness and policy change. A TV
show has taken care of the first part.
There is awareness. Policy makers can
talk about it. But it's about time that
they take up the baton and do the work.
There's so much liberation happening
today. Liberation from a booming stock
market. Liberation from falling
inflation and from economic
prosperity. This has to be a unique move
in political history because there's not
a single country on earth that is
supporting this
policy. That must be some sort of
record. I mean, America has taken a lot
of wrong decisions. Just think back to
when they invaded Iraq. Even then, good
old Britain stood by the
Americans. But now, the US has lost
London, too. It's a sign of too much
liberation.
