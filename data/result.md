## 4. US Potential Return to Bagram Air Base

### 4.0 Intro to Topic
  - The US is considering a return to the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, abandoned in 2021.
  - This move comes under the Trump administration and follows a previous chaotic withdrawal.
  - The Taliban's stance on the US return remains unclear, although some reports suggest a tacit agreement.

### 4.1 US Activity at Bagram
  - An American C-17 military plane landed at Bagram, offloading military hardware and intelligence officials, including the CIA deputy chief.
  - Some reports indicate the Taliban handed Bagram back to the US, although the Taliban denies this.

### 4.2 Trump's Rationale for Return
  - Trump stated that Bagram's strategic location (close to China's nuclear missile sites) justifies the US return.
  -  The base's proximity to China (less than an hour's flight to Shenzhen) would allow for increased monitoring.
  - Bagram's location also offers strategic advantage concerning Iran.

### 4.3 Taliban's Potential Motives
  - The Taliban's willingness to allow the US return could be due to security concerns (countering ISIS-K and Pakistan).
  - Economic incentives (financial aid and potential deals) are also a strong possibility.
  - The release of US citizens and the lifting of bounties on Taliban leaders suggest a developing thaw in relations.


## 5. India's Hidden Naval Base Project

### 5.0 Intro to Topic
  - India is nearing the completion of Project Varsha, a classified military project involving a hidden naval base.
  - The base, located in Rambili, Andhra Pradesh, is designed to house India's nuclear submarine fleet.
  - This project enhances India's naval capabilities and sends a message about its commitment to national security.

### 5.1 Location and Design
  - The base is located 50 km south of Visakhapatnam, chosen for its deep waters providing natural cover for submarines.
  - It will be an underground facility, concealed from satellites and largely unknown to the local population.
  - The base features tunnels and pens for discreet submarine deployment.

### 5.2 Strategic Significance
  - The base will house India's current and future nuclear submarines (aiming for a fleet of 10).
  - This strengthens India's naval power and its second-strike nuclear capabilities.
  - The project is a response to increased Chinese activity in the Indian Ocean, including the presence of Chinese submarines.


## 6. India's Early and Extreme Heatwave

### 6.0 Intro to Topic
  - India is experiencing an early and intense heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 40°C in several northern states.
  - This early heatwave is a sign of worsening climate change impacts, including shorter spring seasons and more intense heatwaves.
  -  India has improved its preparedness for heatwaves, but further actions are needed for long-term mitigation.

### 6.1 Heatwave Conditions
  - Temperatures are exceeding 40°C in northern India (Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat).
  - Delhi recorded 40.2°C, expected to reach 41°C.
  - Gujarat experienced temperatures of 45°C and issued an orange alert.
  - Heatwaves are starting earlier, lasting longer, and becoming more intense compared to previous years.

### 6.2 India's Preparedness and Future Challenges
  - The IMD provides accurate forecasts and alerts states about impending heatwaves.
  - At least 23 states have heat action plans, including low-cost interventions (shade, water access, adjusted work hours).
  - Experts recommend long-term interventions like improved hospital preparedness, fire management, and greener cities.
  - The need for preventive measures alongside immediate responses is highlighted.


## 7. De-extinction of the Dire Wolf

### 7.0 Intro to Topic
  - Colossal Biosciences claims to have successfully de-extincted the dire wolf, a species extinct for 12,500 years.
  - This achievement raises scientific and ethical questions regarding de-extinction and its implications.
  - The dire wolf pups are currently under observation, raising concerns about their well-being and potential health issues.

### 7.1 De-extinction Process and Results
  - Colossal used DNA extracted from dire wolf fossils to modify the genes of grey wolves.
  - Three dire wolf pups (two males, one female) have been born using surrogate domestic dogs.
  - The resulting animals are genetically modified wolves, not exact replicas of extinct dire wolves.

### 7.2 Ethical and Scientific Concerns
  - The pups' well-being is a concern due to their isolation and lack of parental care.
  - The long-term health and reproductive capabilities of genetically modified animals are unclear.
  - Critics question the allocation of resources to de-extinction versus conservation of existing endangered species.
