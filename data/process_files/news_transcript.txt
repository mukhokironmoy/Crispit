Sharma just when you thought it couldn't
go worse Donald Trump has done it he has
raised tariffs on China to
245% he's also warning America's trade
partners in Europe choose between the US
and China so Trump is taking the war
beyond America meanwhile China says it
is open to talks but the US should show
respect first other countries are
planning stimulus packages to cushion
their economies from the trade war and
Russia is benefiting from all of this as
the US dollar falls the Russian ruble is
soaring it is the world's top performing
currency it is doing better than gold

10 10 20
54
1045 and
245 this is not a cricket scorecard this
is Donald Trump's tariffs on China it
began with a 10% levy in February it now
stands at
245% i'll repeat that for you the US has
increased tariffs on China to
245% the White House announced it
yesterday though this time with less
fanfare no grandstanding by the press
secretary no all caps post on Truth
Social instead this announcement was
sneaked into a White House fact sheet
and the reason for this hike because
China retaliated trump says 75 countries
have reached out to him they want to
strike a deal with the US but China has
not reached out instead they have
imposed a 125% tariff on the
US so what does Trump do he hikes it
again to 245% the White House says the
ball is now in China's court look the
president has v made his position on
China quite clear although I do have an
additional statement that he just shared
with me um in the Oval Office um the
ball is in China's court china needs to
make a deal with us we don't have to
make a deal with
them forget the ball there is no court
left to play in a 245% tariff is not a
pressure tactic or a retaliation it is
simply an ego move you just heard the
press secretary she she says that China
needs to make a deal with the US not the
other way around china should be the one
making the deal so clearly the White
House wants a deal with China they just
want Beijing to make the first move
the question is how will China respond
beijing had ruled out further tariff
hikes last week they said anything more
than 125% is a
joke that is China's tariff on the US
125% they will not hike it further as
for talks China is open to it they have
appointed a new trade on war for
negotiations but only on the basis of
mutual
respect if the US truly wants to resolve
the issue through dialogue and
negotiation it should stop its practice
of maximum pressure and cease with
threats and blackmail instead it should
engage in talks with China on the basis
of equality mutual respect and
reciprocity
let me recap that for you the US wants
China to pick up the phone and call
Donald Trump but China is saying "Stop
the bullying lift the tariffs first and
then we can talk." Like I said it's an
ego battle neither side wants to appear
weak and Trump is going the extra mile
the tariffs are just one part of his
strategy he's piling the pressure on his
allies too
a top Trump official has issued an
ultimatum to Europe he wants Brussels to
pick between American and Chinese
technology specifically communications
technology let me give you the
background here elon Musk Starlink is
trying to enter the European market but
a lot of countries are apprehensive they
do not like his meddling in European
politics
nor do they like his president's tariffs
the US president's tariffs so what does
the US do it issues a Bollywood style
ultimatum either pick us or the Chinese
let me quote what US officials said if
you're concerned about Starling just
wait for the Chinese Communist Party's
version then you'll be really
worried now to be fair he does have a
point the problem is the Americans are
also
unreliable it's like a rerun of the Cold
War back then the Americans had the same
attitude you're either with us or
against us and Trump is reviving that
Cold War approach
it's bad news for America's trading
partners until now the trade war was
limited to the US and China but now
Trump is taking it beyond those arenas
he is asking other countries to publicly
choose and China knows this they know
that many countries are rethinking their
partnership with the US so they're
trying to cash in and China's strategy
has been twofold the first is to attack
the US no diplomacy or outry just
full-on wolf warrior attacks china state
media is taking the lead here let me
quote from their current their recent
piece this was published in a Chinese
mouthpiece the US is not getting ripped
off by anybody the problem is the US has
been living beyond its means for decades
it consumes more than it produces the US
should stop whining about itself being a
victim in global trade and put an end to
its capricious and destructive
behavior now this approach has a clear
motive to present China as a challenger
to the US as the only country standing
up to Donald
Trump which brings us to the second part
of China's strategy reaching out to
partners xi Jinping is on a tour of
Southeast Asia he has visited Vietnam
and Malaysia already his next stop is
Cambodia
do you know what's common between all
these countries all of them face steep
tariffs from Donald Trump so Xi Jinping
is sweeping in as as a savior as the
wise statesman who is taking on Trump
listen to what he said
we must uphold the multilateral trading
system keep global industrial and supply
chain stable and maintain an
international environment of openness
and cooperation
how about that china is preaching
cooperation and
openness on most days it would sound
absurd but then you look at Donald Trump
and you think maybe not the US is
squandering its goodwill across the
world and by extension playing into
China's
hands this is a clash between the art of
the deal and the art of war let's see
how it unfolds
so Trump has raised tariffs on China
once again his trade policies are
setting off alarm bells across the globe
world leaders are scrambling to contain
the
fallout how will they respond to Trump's
tariffs what is their toolkit of
choice
stimulus pumping cash into the economy
it is a time-t tested strategy and many
major economies are now deploying it
like South Korea which has unveiled a
supplementary budget this package is
worth over $8 billion and where will
this extra money go in managing the
risks from Trump's trade war and in
boosting South Korea's AI
capabilities that alone the AI
capabilities will get about a third of
this fund a third of $8 billion at the
same time Seoul is exploring
negotiations with Washington it will
soon send a team to the US to try to cut
a deal with the Trump
administration of course there's no
guarantee of a deal which is why South
Korea has armed itself with a financial
war
chest same with Portugal they have
announced an 11 billion package their
prime minister says and I'm
quoting "The world we knew has changed."
His name is Luis Montenegro he's a
Portuguese prime minister and he says
that his country must adapt quickly to
this changing reality portugal's
neighbor Spain is doing the same thing
last week the Spanish government
announced a $15 billion package and just
like Portugal it's a mix of loans and
direct aid spain plans to boost spending
in defense
the objective of this plan is for Spain
to contribute to and at the same time
benefit from this technological and
industrial stimulus to strengthen the
European security and defense area while
remaining faithful to our principles
stimulus packages are direct
interventions clearly these countries
don't want to wait for Trump to change
his mind and offer concessions and that
is why they're resorting to stimulus and
building a safety net around their
economies china is under pressure to
follow suit in fact Beijing could be
readying a package as we speak analysts
predict a massive stimulus push of up to
$275 billion $275 billion china stimulus
package last month Beijing raised its
deficit target now what's a deficit when
a government spends more than it earns
when its expenses are higher than its
income that gap is called a budget
deficit now earlier China was targeting
a def deficit of 3% but last month they
raised it to
4% this gives Beijing more room to
spend more firepower to protect their
economy in the month of March the
government also dropped some hints
to cope with possible external and
domestic uncertainties the central
government has also set aside ample
reserve tools and policy space
now this is not new most governments
resort to a stimulus package during a
crisis we saw it happen during the 2008
crash we also s saw it happen during the
pandemic stimulus packages keep
economies afloat but this time the
threat is different this time it's a
trade war and the rising risk of
recession the markets are still wobbly
share prices are seessawing if Trump
reimposes his tariffs there could be
another mass selloff businesses and
their bottom lines would suffer costs
would rise profit margins would fall and
economies could plunge into
recession trump's gamble on tariffs has
has raised all these fears in the US
alone the probability of a recession is
as high as
60% and the global economy is flashing
warning signs the IEA has slashed the
demand for oil for 2025 the IEA is the
International Energy Agency it predicts
lower demand for oil so does the OPEC
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries this is the world's biggest
and most powerful oil cartel now both
these groups blame the rising trade
tensions for this for projecting lower
oil
demand you see global growth is slowing
so even if you cut oil prices it may not
be enough to lift demand hence the need
for a stimulus it can cushion the blow
support jobs prop up demand and restore
market confidence but it's not a silver
bullet if Trump's tariff war
continues and if his tariffs rise
further no amount of cash may be
enough because this is not just a
financial storm it is also a political
one the global economy as we know it is
being
reshaped there could be more painful
days ahead

now let's talk about Russia it is an
outlier in the global trade war donald
Trump has spared Russia from his tariffs
and that is clearly helping the Russian
economy their currency the ruble is
soaring against the odds the ruble has
become the best performing currency in
the
world it has surged past every major
competitor including gold the Russian
currency is doing better than gold
remember gold is the go-to safe haven
during tough times but today the ruble
is doing better than gold this year it
has gained 38% against the US dollar a
38% rise in the global market the dollar
on the other hand is struggling you
could say Trump crashed the dollar with
his tariffs his trade war has triggered
a major crisis of confidence in the
greenback but that's not the only reason
why the ruble is shining overall
Moscow's economic strategy is working
three factors are driving the rubles's
rise first a political thaw between
Putin and Trump this has eased fears
about the future of the Russian economy
it has boosted confidence in Russian
assets second tight monetary controls
russia has curbed the demand for foreign
goods this has led to reduced imports
and it has left more foreign currency in
Russian coffers and the third reason
government intervention the Kremlin is
using its national wealth fund it has
been selling foreign currencies like the
US dollar and the British pound and this
helps support the ruble it fuels the
kind of rally that we are now
seeing russia is confident about its
economic trajectory at the same time the
Kremlin admits that there are challenges
ahead
right now our economy is developing
quite successfully it is stable and has
a high margin of stability however
additional efforts will be required
given the turbulence we are currently
experiencing in the global economy
so what are these challenges one of them
is the price of oil earlier this month
oil prices dropped one barrel of
Russia's eurals crude was trading at
almost $50 that's the lowest price level
in almost two years $50 for a barrel and
the outlook is worsening like we just
told you the demand for oil is set to
fall the International Energy Agency and
the oil cartel OPEC have both cut
forecasts they say that trade tensions
are hitting global demand and when the
demand for energy
slows Russia makes less money
needless to say this is bad news for the
Russian economy because it depends
heavily on energy revenues last year
Russia earned more than $100 billion
from oil and gas
sales if price drops if demand falls
Moscow will earn less and it will have
less money to
spend in fact the Russian Central Bank
has issued a
warning if Trump's trade war escalates
global trade will slow down so will the
demand for Russian oil and gas and this
could weaken the Russian
economy i can say that we will approach
this carefully cautiously including
remembering that last year after a
slowdown at the beginning of the year
inflation raised its head again and we
need to make sure that the current
slowdown in the rate of price growth is
sustainable another factor is the
tectonic changes in global trade they
are unfolding before our eyes and it is
still very difficult to judge where they
will lead both the global economy and
how they will affect
Russia this is a new significant risk
that we must take into
account so falling oil prices is one
major risk the other is a slowing
Russian economy there's also a labor
shortage it is driving up wages the
number of young workers is shrinking
many of them have been recruited in the
military so there are fewer people to
take up other jobs and this impacts the
economy directly because fewer workers
means higher labor costs for
businesses the third issue is rising
inflation at the moment it is above 10%
more than 10% inflation that's well
beyond the Russian central bank's
comfort zone to fight inflation they
hiked interest rates to
21% so there's a fair bit of pressure on
multiple fronts does that mean that
Russia is in trouble well far from it
the country has weathered worse since
the Ukraine war Russia has been under
more than 20,000 sanctions all imposed
by the West in a bid to isolate
Russia but Moscow managed to adapt it
found ways to bypass restrictions it
took advantage of the slow uneven
sanctions enforcement it used its vast
natural resources all of this gave the
Russian economy time to
adjust and the result was long-term
resilience
even as pressures mount Russia's economy
remains in the fight the ruble is
holding strong as the world comes to
terms with Trump's trade war the Russian
economy is looking good

morgan Stanley ear projected 6 and a
half% growth for India now they have cut
it to
6.1% this is for the ongoing financial
year which is from April 2025 to March
2026 they've also revised the rates for
the next financial year from 6.5% to
6.3% and it's not just banks and
agencies even the Reserve Bank of India
has slashed its forecast from
6.7% to
6.5% so the overwhelming opinion is
clear that tariffs will hurt India's
economic
targets but don't panic yet because
there are a number of silver linings for
starters inflation is cooling last month
retail inflation fell to 3.34% which is
the lowest level since August 2019 the
lowest level of inflation since August
2019 and a big reason for that is food
prices india's inflation is largely
driven by seasonal food prices a good
harvest will bring them down a flood or
a heat wave will make it worse in the
month of March food inflation was just
2.69% in India which is why overall
inflation was also under control and
what about the forecast well that's also
good experts have predicted a bumper
monsoon this year again that is that is
good news for food prices because Indian
farmers are still dependent on a good
monsoon that is their main source of
irrigation it is also good news for the
economy as a whole because lower
inflation leaves the door open for
interest
cuts let me explain how the RBI sets the
benchmark lending rate for all Indian
banks basically the RBI regulates the
interest on your loans if the rate is
lower more people will take loans more
loans equals more spending more spending
equals more economic activity that is
how central banks spur
growth by controlling the interest rate
but the risk is inflation if spending
rises too much so will the
prices that is the risk of cutting
interest rates to boost
growth but in this case the RBI has more
wiggle room inflation is already well
under their two to six% target so there
is more scope to cut interest
rates and like I said this is good news
for the Indian economy especially with
Trump's tariffs on the horizon another
good headline is from the markets india
is the first major market to erase the
tariff
losses now what does that mean trump
announced his sweeping tariffs on the
2nd of April before that on April 1st
the Sensex closed at
76,000 i'm sure you know what happened
next the markets had a couple of really
bad days billions were wiped out from
portfolios now look at the closing rate
today just a shade over 77,000 so the
Indian markets have already recovered to
pre-tariff levels in fact they have gone
beyond those rates other major markets
have not done this yet japan South Korea
China Germany none of them have returned
to those levels but India has what
explains this
resilience for starters India is not an
export-driven economy not like China or
Mexico so the exposure to the tariffs
was always going to be low plus India is
seeking a deal with the US it is not
taking on Donald Trump like China is so
investors are more bullish on India they
feel that India is better suited to come
out
unscathed of course these are still
uncertain times tomorrow Trump could
threaten India with more tariffs and
before you know it the markets could
could tumble
again so we are not saying that the
worst is over we are saying that India
is doing better than other major
economies the key is to build on the
strong foundation to capitalize on the
churn created by Donald
Trump let's see if India rises to the
challenge
have you ever heard of the lipstick
index when a recession looms lipstick
sales typically go up do you know why
because people cannot afford big luxury
items so they splurge on smaller things
like lipstick to lift their
spirits when most people think recession
they imagine the big stuff stock market
crashes massive layoffs grim warnings
from the JP Morgan CEO but the first
signs are usually more
subtle a canceled hair appointment a
homemade lunch instead of
takeout those little everyday choices
that add up and right now the US is
seeing a lot of them so can these small
indicators really predict a
recession our next report takes a closer
look
recession forecasting is usually serious
business economists hunched over GDP
charts obsessing over stock market
tremors technically a recession means
the economy shrinks for two straight
quarters but let's be real by the time
that shows up in official data everyone
has already felt it groceries suddenly
feel more expensive your favorite lunch
spot is weirdly empty and your hair may
be overdue for a
touchup economists might rely on models
and graphs but out here in the real
world there are stranger and
surprisingly more accurate ways to spot
an economic downturn they're called
unofficial indicators totally
unscientific but eerily on
point take the humble salon for example
in 2024 the average American woman spent
over $1,000 a year on her appearance now
hair stylists are noticing something
strange appointments are getting pushed
back clients are asking for cheaper
services and on Tik Tok there's a new
trend called recession blonde women are
letting their roots grow in skipping
costly maintenance even nails are
feeling the pinch manicures are out
pressons are in in fact US searches for
press on nails are up 10% since February
but it's not just the beauty routines
it's also the tiny everyday choices
people make or don't make when money
gets tight take men's underwear and no
we're not kidding in a recession
underwear sales drop why because it's
one of the first things people stop
buying it's about postponing
non-essential purchases so you stretch
what you've got quite
literally but then there's lipstick and
it does the opposite sales actually go
up during a downturn because even when
wallets are squeezed people still crave
a little luxury and lipstick is perfect
small affordable and mood lifting you
can't buy a new car or maybe even a new
bag but a $10 lipstick that's still
within reach and it feels like a win and
it's not just what people wear it's also
what they eat and drink too take beer
for example during a recession craft
brews fall flat cheap six-packs are back
in style because taste takes a backseat
to savings and lunch even that gets a
recession makeover in the United States
more people are bringing meals from home
and it's not just for the protein to
carb ratio it's to save some money when
budgets shrink the first things to go
are the little indulgences the avocado
toast and $5 coffee is out but homemade
lunch is in now these might seem like
small sacrifices but when you stack them
up there's a very real very quiet
economic shift and they've always
existed take the hemline index for
example historically skirt lengths could
tell you how the economy was doing
during the 1920s the economy was roaring
and that's when flapper girls showed up
with kneelength dresses it was all about
freedom and prosperity but the 1930s
brought with it the Great Depression
money disappeared and so did the knees
hemlines drop to the ankles reflecting a
more somber conservative era of course
with fast fashion it's harder to track
now but indicators like this show you a
bigger picture because the economy
doesn't just live in a silo can these
quirky metrics really predict a
recession maybe not with complete
precision but they do tap into something
raw and honest how we adapt when things
look down because before the recession
makes headlines it shows up in the
details once upon a time luxury was made
in Europe france had Chanel italy had
Gucci the UK had Burberry the West made
these brands the East made the knockoffs
that was how it worked but today the
picture is quite different china
manufactures a vast majority of luxury
goods sometimes legally sometimes
questionably but always
quietly that's how it was until last
week but now those Chinese factories are
speaking up and that too on Tik Tok do
you recognize this style this bag of
course you do for the past more than 30
years we have been OEM factory for most
of the luxury brands around the world
gucci PLA Coach Louis Vuitton you name
it but for this I am not proud because
we were only making our wages the profit
margin for the people who are actually
making the bags are very
low the reason is quite clear the US and
China are fighting a trade war
washington has imposed
245% in tariffs on China
so Beijing is sitting back not just with
reciprocal tariffs or restrictions but
also with a luxury expose you know who
is producing highquality accessories for
those luxury brands like Chanel as
Lauder L'Oreal you're saying you are the
supplier behind all these beauty
accessories for those big luxury brands
la Pria MAC Chinara Bobby Brown and even
Rosewood
Hotel all these videos have a similar
setup there's a person standing in a
factory they show off luxury goods they
mention the prices and that is a shocker
i guess everyone knew that luxury goods
were overpriced
but the markup and the way it is being
presented has caught people's attention
take a Birkin bag for example we told
you about this yesterday a video claims
that a bag is made in China for $1,400
all things
included and how much does Hermes sell
it for $38,000 that's a markup of over
2,600%
2,600% markup to sum those up the total
cost will be 1,400 USD for one person
working out of factory but why Hermes
will charge you 38,000 USD for one bag
that's because more than 90% of the
price is paid for it logo but if you do
not care about the logo you just want
the same quality same material you can
just buy from us because for our bags we
use exactly the same material the same
leather same hardware same edge
oil imagine that for years luxury brands
have carefully curated a fantasy part
heritage part exclusivity and a whole
lot of
gloss a handbag from Hermes is not just
a bag it's a passport into an elite club
of wealth
a $100 pair of Lululemon leggings is not
just another set of pants it's doing
yoga in
style but China's is now breaking this
illusion one video at a time it is
appealing to Western customers directly
with one message buy that Burkin but buy
it directly from the source you will not
get the Hermes logo but at least it it
will be
$37,000
cheaper so what is Beijing hoping to
achieve with this and more importantly
should you buy these products is a
$1,400 Burkin too good to be
true and first things first this is
China we're talking about so take all of
this with a pinch of salt maybe the
whole shaker the videos may just be
propaganda supported by statebacked
actors with ring lights the bags may be
knockoffs after all China is the world's
biggest counterfeit producer it makes
86% of the world's fakes and copies 86%
so it could be a very highquality
dupe but Beijing's aim here is not to
sell these products it is to undermine
western luxury you see luxury brands
have spent decades spinning tails tuscan
leather artisans French atilers lit by
candle light bags stitched by
hand but behind all of this lies a very
pragmatic reality the reality of
globalized manufacturing the bag may say
made in Italy but it's quite possible
that only the clasp was attached in
Italy the rest of the bag was made in
China that's a very real possibility so
what these videos do is shatter that
image of luxury and not just that
they're also trying to kill two birds
with one stone they're taking on Western
brands and they're also stirring
economic nationalism in
China for years made in China was seen
as cheap
these videos are rebranding it as
luxurious
they aim to show China as a producer of
quality not just quantity
so should you buy
them well it is an expensive gamble you
may end up with a real thing or you may
end up with a costly counterfeit and
chances are you won't be able to tell
the difference also it depends on what
you are you're really looking for are
you looking for authenticity are you
looking for quality or do you just want
the brand
logo because let's face it a Birkin is
never just a bag when you pay
$38,000 for any bag you're not really
paying for the stitches or the leather
you're paying for the
story and that's the real luxury
product china is not just challenging
the product it is challenging that
illusion and if that myth falls
apart what are we really paying
for the West sold the world a dream and
now China has turned on the
lights our next story is about Ukraine a
country fighting for survival cities are
in ruins and foreign aid is drying up so
Ukraine has a new plan to fill its war
chest it is as bold as it is revealing
ukraine wants to legalize pornography it
sees millions in tax revenue imagine
only fans as an unofficial defense
partner what is the new cost of freedom
for Ukraine it could be monthly
subscriptions to adult
content for some this is innovation but
many see this as desperation our next
report
explores the war in Ukraine is now in
its third year keev has lost thousands
of soldiers
millions have been displaced
infrastructure has been destroyed
western allies are reducing their aid
and Ukraine is fighting for survival
you're not in a good position you don't
have the cards right now
the war has crippled its economy
ukraine's coffers are drying up kev is
desperate for funds
so what does a cashstrapped nation do
apparently it turns to
pornography yes Ukraine wants to
legalize the adult entertainment
industry lawmaker Yaroslav Jalesnyak is
leading the
initiative possession production and
distribution of pornography is banned in
Ukraine and Ukrainian lawmakers want to
overturn the Soviet era law they feel
legalizing pornography will boost the
economy it will generate millions of
dollars in tax revenue not to mention it
would free up the Ukrainian police from
pursuing the 1400 cases regarding adult
content
the bill has been co-signed by at least
26 lawmakers including members of
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zilinski's
party but many Orthodox Christians in
Ukraine are questioning the move
they say legalizing pornography will
erode the social fabric of the
country ukrainian churches are calling
it a destructive initiative but is this
a strategic move or a sign of
despair the adult content industry
generates about $100 billion every year
and one of its emerging contributors is
Only Fans this digital platform makes
more than $6 billion every year and
Ukraine wants to milk this cash
cow ukrainians have made more than $123
million on Only Fans over 4,400
Ukrainians earn from the platform but
only 10% filed taxes from their earnings
which crossed more than $7
million and many Ukrainians have been
using Only Fans to raise funds for the
army lawmakers feel that legalizing
pornography could increase tax
collections to more than $12
million and this money could be spent
for buying drones ammunition or other
weapons but will legalizing pornography
solve Ukraine's financial crisis well
not particularly the tax collections
won't even make a splash because Keev
relies heavily on foreign aid which is
not in the millions but
billions the largest amount has come
from the United States it's estimated to
be around 128
billion then there's Germany France and
the United Kingdom followed by other
NATO allies like Italy the Netherlands
Norway and Sweden all of these countries
have given billions to Ukraine not to
mention the weapons that were given free
of
cost tax collections from pornography
won't put Ukraine's ever growing war
bill but Ukraine is desperate for funds
and it's open to all options that are on
the table including legalizing
pornography
if Ukraine manages to do that it would
be the first country in the world to
legalize pornography for funding its
military will this become a trend will
war on nations turn to unconventional
methods for cash we've already seen
crypto donations and crowdsourced
drones and now we may just have only
fans funded artillery
now we turn to the forgotten war the one
in
Sudan this week marks two years of the
civil war yet there were no worldwide
protests no social media appro clearly
all eyes are not on the Sudan but the
North African nation is still in turmoil
and the civil war is only escalating you
may remember how it began and gunfire
and explosions rocked the country on
April 15 2023 and at the heart of this
chaos are two groups one is the Sudanese
army the other is a paramilitary group
called the RSF the rapid support forces
RSF now these two sides are logged in a
power struggle it's basically an ego
clash each side is led by a general
heading the army is General Abdul Fat
Al- Burhan leading the RSF is General
Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo better known as
Hemeti now Burhan and Hemeti are allies
turned rivals in 2021 they were partners
they launched a joint coup they toppled
the Sudanese government then they faced
a question who will rule Sudan the army
or the RSF well they couldn't decide
they couldn't share power so now they're
fighting they've been fighting for 2
years their war has shattered the
country tens of thousands of innocents
have been killed nearly 14 million
people have been displaced that's almost
onethird of the country's population
hospitals are being bombed there's a
genocide waves of ethnic cleansing women
and children are being mass raped more
than half the population is starving
this is the world's worst humanitarian
crisis created by two power hungry
generals they have brought their country
to
knees and now they're splitting it
yesterday the RSF announced a rival
government they said they will govern
the areas they
control the RSF is calling it the road
map for a new
Sudan the Sudan army made a similar
announcement in February basically the
two rivals want to rule their respective
turfs so who controls what let me show
you with a map the RSF recently lost
control of the capital that is Kartum
but it still holds the Darur region this
is in the west the Sudanese army
controls the north and the east
including Port Sudan which gives them
access to the Red Sea now the RSF has
formed its own government experts fear
that this will divide the
country this is Africa's third biggest
nation we are talking about it is
staring at yet another partition a few
years back the country the country of
South Sudan was carved from Sudan and
now another split is in the works
what is the international community
doing they're playing the bl the blame
game ceasefire talks have collapsed
regional players are taking sides egypt
and Saudi Arabia back the Sudanese army
the UA and charge support the
RSF this has only added fuel to the fire
the African Union remains divided
they're dealing with the refugee crisis
coming out of Sudan the United Nations
as always is missing and the Sudanese
generals say that they will not end the
war anytime soon because both sides
claim that victory is around the
corner like I said the fighting has
forced millions to flee first within
Africa and now to Europe the number of
Sudanese refugees has gone up by 38% in
Europe
alone so the West is finally waking up
the United Kingdom held a summit
yesterday to discuss the Sudan war none
of the waring sides was present and the
meeting ended with no major decision
listen to what France had to say
france has taken note of the road map
presented by the authorities led by the
Sudin armed forces to restore a
political
transition it reiterates the imperative
of effective participation by all
civilian actors within the framework of
a single process i am particularly
concerned by the intentions expressed by
various actors to form governments
unilaterally and outside of any process
of conflict
resolution let us be clear the unity of
Sudan must be preserved
the unity of Sudan must be preserved
that's what France said germany and the
UK said that war is not the solution
they're calling for more
dialogue for the people of Sudan war is
their reality at the moment and they
have a grim
outlook violence and violations there is
no solution except for the war to
continue until the rebellion ends
because those people have no
understanding they have no vision for
the country they are loyal to other
external parties
so where does the Sudan go from here
will it be divided again will the
division bring them peace will the world
finally wake up to their horror or will
Sudan remain the forgotten
war our next story tonight is about
smuggling no not gold or drug smuggling
we will tell you about ant smuggling yes
people are trafficking ants now mainly
in East Africa kenya has nabbed four ant
gang
smugglers they captured thousands of
ants they were planning to sell these
insects in Europe and Asia and hoping to
make thousands of dollars you heard that
right thousands of dollars for ants so
what's behind this strange trafficking
trend and why are people buying smuggled
ants here's our report
kenya has been embroiled in a decadesl
long fight against animal
trafficking people smuggle body parts of
animals such as elephants rhinos and
panggalins and sell them for millions of
dollars on the black
market usually large species of wild
animals fall prey to these illegal
activities but in recent years
trafficking trends have seen a change
the focus is shifting to smaller and
lesserk known species like ants these
tiny creatures are witnessing a huge
interest among
traffickers like the four smugglers who
have been arrested by Kenyan authorities
in two separate
cases two Belgian teenagers have been
charged with wildlife piracy they were
found with thousands of ants at their
guest house
they reportedly seemed distraught during
their appearance in court we did not
came here to break any
laws by accident and
stupidity we did and I know breaking
laws is for criminals but I don't feel
like a criminal
but according to authorities they made
calculated attempts to smuggle the ants
they captured 5,000 ants packed them in
thousands of test tubes and filled them
with cotton wool this would have enabled
the ants to survive for months and
obscured the contents of the
tube two other men have been charged
with illegal trafficking in the same
courtroom one of them is Kenyan the
other is Vietnamese both the men were
arrested in Nairobi where they were
found with 400 ants in their apartments
these cases may sound absurd after all
why would people capture ants because it
is a lucrative business
the contraband included the Messor
sephalotes or the giant African
harvester ants as the name suggests they
are large they can grow up to 25 mm they
have a bold color they're native to East
Africa and they're considered exotic
mainly in Europe and
Asia where the so-called ant smugglers
plan to take them if they were
successful in all likelihood they would
have made a bounty the prices vary
according to the market but each giant
African harvester ant can be sold for
anywhere between $130 to
$220 and according to the Kenya Wildlife
Service the total ant contraband is
valued at 1 million shillings that is
$7,700 question is why are people buying
these ants demand in this rare insect
species is growing rapidly due to their
distinct features collectors like to
keep them in special habitats which are
known as
formicariums and watch them build
colonies so people are keeping ants as
pets and paying big bucks to do
it of course Kenya is not happy about
this in the country ants are protected
by international biodiversity treaties
their trade is highly
regulated because they are critical from
an ecological perspective they help
enrich soils germinate seeds and provide
food for birds and other
animals and Kenya has taken the illegal
export of these ants seriously they say
that this not only undermines Kenya's
sovereign rights over its biodiversity
but also deprivives local communities
and research institutions of potential
ecological and economic benefits
the Kenya Wildlife Service has called
the arrest of ant smugglers a landmark
case the country can only hope that this
sets an example and puts a stop to the
antics of ant
traffickers our last story tonight is
about a drink a drink that ancient
Egyptian kings were buried with in
ancient China people revered it as a god
in ancient Greece poets said that
drinking it is like tasting the
pleasures of life before death in case
you haven't guessed it I'm talking about
wine for centuries now wine has had
quite the fan following but in the
modern world this fandom is slowly
fading the w the main trade body of wine
has released a report it looks at
government data from around the world
and here's what it says last year wine
consumption hit its lowest level in
decades global sales fell 3.3% compared
to 2023 they reached about 214 million
hecto liters one hecter is 100
L so 214 million hecters seems like a
very big number but apparently it's not
it is the lowest global sales figure
since 1961 the lowest in more than 60
years
so wine sales are in the red and so is
wine production which has also hit the
lowest level in more than 60 years
production fell by
4.8% in 2024 now if you look closely
there are some anomalies like India
india's vineyard area is growing
dramatically it is expanding at an
annual rate of 4 and
a.5% or Spain and Portugal these are
among the few European markets where
consumption has increased europe is the
world's biggest wine producer it
accounts for nearly half of global sales
but last year consumption fell by
2.8% france was one of the is one of the
key producers of wine it consumed 3.6%
less wine last year and the US is in the
same boat it is the world's top wine
consumer it saw a fall of 5.8% last year
that's the US
and there is not one but three reasons
why this is happening one is health
concerns two change in consumption
patterns and three climate change we'll
start with the last one climate change
global warming it has fueled
environmental extremes it has hurt wine
production take Italy for instance it
used to be the world's top producer of
wine but extreme floods and droughts
have ruined the crop and in 2023 it lost
the
title of the biggest
producer or look at the US last year its
wine output fell by about 17% mainly
because of extreme heat and the these
examples are everywhere but that's not
the biggest reason why wine is falling
out of favor the biggest reason is
health
concerns it's rising awareness about
wine you may have heard of the French
paradox this concept came up in the
early
1990s what is the French paradox they
said red wine was good for your heart
moderate consumption of red wine will
lower the risk of heart
disease studies raved about the benefits
of wine and sales took a leap for years
the wine industry has benefited from
this notion but here's the catch many of
these studies were fueled by the alcohol
industry basically wine makers paid
money to create this positive perception
they showed the benefits of drinking and
people bought their claims and their
bottles but that is no longer the case
such research has long been debunked
people now know that there is no safe
level of drinking any kind of alcohol
including wine nothing is safe according
to studies one bottle of wine per week
is as bad as five cigarettes for men and
10 for women and consumers are
increasingly aware about this risk now
couple this with a third factor the
change in consumption patterns young
people are having lesser wine experts
say there is a there is a generational
fall in
consumption and those who want to are
having trouble buying it because look at
the cost the average consumer now pays
about 30% more for a bottle than in 2020
so prices have shot up dramatically in
the last 5 years wine consumption has
fallen by 12%
simply put the societal view of wine is
changing the industry is beset with
challenges and the future of wine is not
looking
good it seems that wino clock will soon
be marked with a glass half empty
[Music]
you may or may not like Donald Trump but
you have to admit he's a brave man who
else would challenge the Chinese to a
math face
off and that's what it is now it's a
question of who can throw up the bigger
number trump has gone all the way up to
245% it's a bit like those games of
poker you see on TV very high stakes
very dramatic moves and a lot of money
on the line
the question is who will fold first
people on the internet are wondering too
take a
[Music]
[Applause]
look heat heat
[Music]
[Music]
turn down the world
and now it's time for vantage shots
images that tell the story a drone video
captures multiple Russian strikes in
Ukraine's Keron authorities rescue a

one to a bookshop's new location finally
we are taking you back in history on
this day in 2005 Pakistan's former
military ruler turned president Burves
Musharov arrived in India to watch a
cricket match musharov even praised
Indian hospitality during this trip he
held meetings with then Prime Minister
Dr manm Singh this was his first visit

summit in 2001 we're leaving you on that
note thank you for watching we'll see
