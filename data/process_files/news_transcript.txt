what he said and what has China said
what will this deal mean for the rest of
the world we'll discuss that among all
those watching will be Nvidia the chip
giant they're caught in the crossfire
their boss is dining with Trump and
wooing Xi Jinping as he stares at
billions in losses meanwhile Trump is
going after Chinese ships to level the
playing field for American ship builders
but how did China come to dominate
global
shipping what do we make of Bangladesh
asking Pakistan to apologize for 1971
are they serious how Google's ad
business is being called out as an
illegal monopoly how China is fighting
proxy wars by helping the Houthis in

i believe we're going to have a deal
with China
[Music]
it's hard to analyze President Trump's
actions he's so erratic and volatile but
one good measure is his rhetoric that
gives you an idea about where he stands
on his so-called liberation day when he
announced tariffs on the whole world the
rhetoric meter was through the roof
trump accused other countries of raping
and pillaging America 15 days later the
meter has cooled down he's been raising
tariffs on China like a monopoly game
but that tit fortat could be
ending us President Trump has hinted
that he wouldn't go higher than 245%
well in a certain point I don't want
them to go higher because at a certain
point you make it where people don't buy
so I may not want to go higher or I may
not want to even go up to that level i
may want to go to less because you know
you want people to buy and at a certain
point people aren't going to buy
not just that he's also looking for a
deal trump claims that China has reached
out to him for talks and he says a deal
could be struck in weeks listen to this
sorry has he called you directly
President Xi or reached out well you'd
think it was pretty obvious that he has
but we will talk about that soon it's
not that important because honestly
we're going to have a deal i believe
we're going to have a deal with China
how much time i would I would think over
the next three or four weeks I think
maybe the whole thing could be concluded
3 to four weeks if Trump is serious this
is good news but it also exposes his
hand just think back to what he said
leading up to the tariffs that America
had been ripped off that America had to
bring back jobs that the trade deficit
had to be wiped out can you strike a
deal to solve these problems in one
month logic says no but Trump may not
have an option investors and businesses
are questioning his policy elon Musk is
distancing himself foreign allies are
looking for other options so Trump is
pretty much alone here not even his
central bank is supporting this campaign
i'm talking about the US Federal Reserve
or the Fed as they call it its chair was
appointed by Trump back in 2018 his name
is Jerome Powell now Powell is not a fan
of these tariffs he says it will raise
inflation and slow down growth
unemployment is likely to go up as the
economy slows in all likelihood and
inflation is likely to go up as tariffs
find their way and some part of those
tariffs come to the um come to be paid
by the by the by the public so that's
the strong likelihood
powell was also asked about the stock
markets would he intervene if they
collapse too much the answer was a
resounding no needless to say Trump is
angry about this he wants the Fed to
lower the interest rates only then will
Americans get cheaper loans only then
can they spend
freely but Jerome Powell is in no mood
to do that he is expecting inflation to
rise so the last thing on his mind is a
rate cut where does that leave Donald
Trump first he lashed out on social
media he said Powell's termination
cannot come fast
enough his plan is to ask the Fed chief
to resign
you said that the termination of Jerome
Powell cannot come fast enough he says
he won't leave even if you ask him to oh
he'll leave if I ask him to he'll be out
of there i don't think he's doing the
job he's uh too late always too late a
little slow and I'm not happy with him
uh I let him know it and uh Oh if I want
him out he'll be out of there real fast
believe me
just one problem though jerome Powell is
not planning to resign after Trump won
in November he was specifically asked
about this would he step aside if Trump
asked him to listen to the response
some of the president's elect's advisers
have suggested that you should resign um
if he asked you to leave would you go no
uh can you follow up on is Do you think
that legally he you're not required to
leave no
so it's a stalemate trump wants Jerome
Powell to leave but the Fed chief has no
intention of doing so then what can
Trump do can the president simply fire
him many American legal scholars are
debating this they agree that it's a
gray untested area and there is a reason
why no US president has tried to fire
the Fed chief before it's a
wellestablished norm central banks
operate independently the government
will not interfere in their
decision-m and this isn't just true for
America it's true for most democracies
so the idea itself is risky and
dangerous it would undermine confidence
in the US economy nonetheless let's look
at the legality of it the US Central
Bank is governed by the Federal Reserve
Act it does allow governors and board
members to be fired but only with
cause and what qualifies as a cause
misconduct or incapacity policy
disagreements do not qualify so Trump's
move is unlikely to hold up in a court
of law plus the Fed's independence has
bipartisan support even some Republicans
may not support such a move to fire the
Fed chief another option is to demote
Jerome Powell you see the Fed has seven
board members they're all nominated by
the president for 14 years the Fed chair
is also a board member so some scholars
say that Trump could demote Powell
basically strip the chairmanship but
keep him as a member again this is
uncharted territory the final decision
will likely be taken by the Supreme
Court of the US in fact the court is
hearing a similar case right now like
the Fed there are dozens of independent
agencies in the US government and
President Trump has asked the court
whether he can fire
them old procedure says he cannot not
unless there is misconduct or incapacity
but let's see if the court sets a new
procedent and if they do it could boost
Trump's
case the question is at what cost the US
Fed is the most important central bank
in the world other central banks and
bankers take cues from the
Fed it is also the custodian of gold
reserves belonging to dozens of
countries so the Fed's independence is a
cornerstone of the US economy you take
that out the whole house could collapse
[Music]
donald Trump has opened a new front in
the US China trade war the battleground
is artificial intelligence and caught in
the crossfire is
Nvidia the tech company it makes the
world's most popular AI chips it powers
the world's most used AI apps from Chad
GPT to China's Deep Seek they all run on
Nvidia apparently more than 35,000
companies use Nvidia to build AI and now
Nvidia is at the center of the US China
rivalry their CEO is a man called Jensen
Huang he has made a major gamble huang
has gone to China in the middle of all
of this he landed in Beijing yesterday
and this trip came out of the blue the
timing could not have been worse a few
days ago Trump issued an order he banned
Nvidia from selling a special kind of
chip a chip called the
H20 again this is an AI chip nvidia
built it specifically for China they
built it to evade Joe Biden's export
controls remember when Biden was
president he had banned the sales of
advanced AI chips to China so the H20
the H20 chip was a workaround a less
powerful chip that complied with
America's export
curbs but then Trump has added to those
curbs and he has effectively banned the
sale of H20 chips to China these chips
were in huge demand chinese tech giants
had played placed large orders for H20
the likes of Alibaba Tencent Bite Dance
they' all ordered chips worth $18
billion that's a big chunk of revenue
for Nvidia 18 billion last year China
accounted for over 17 billion of this
company's
earnings that's more than 19% of
Nvidia's global earnings and the revenue
from H20 alone is a billion dollars
higher 18 billion so you can imagine how
much this ban hurts Nvidia their
earnings will take a hit a $5.5 billion
hit and the full exit will be even more
painful but that's where we are headed
if Trump has his way that's right but
the tariffs will be in place uh in the
notistant future because as you know
like we did with steel like we did with
automobiles like we did with aluminum
which are now fully on we'll be doing
that with semiconductors with chips and
numerous other things and we wanted to
uncomplicate it from a lot of other
companies because we want to make our
chips and semiconductors and other
things in our country
he doesn't want China to get access to
advanced
technology but the Nvidia boss is not
ready to give up yet that's Jensen Huang
he met with Chinese trade groups and
leaders today and he gave them an
assurance he called China and I'm
quoting a very important market for
Nvidia and he said that he wants to
continue cooperating with Chinese
firms chinese mouthpieces have carried
some
quotes this is what they've said nvidia
would spare no effort to build to build
compliant products and unswervingly
serve the Chinese market apparently
that's what Jensen Huang told the
Chinese
the message was diplomatic but the
intention was unmistakable nvidia is not
walking away despite Washington's
restrictions despite growing scrutiny
from both sides this company is
exploring options it is looking to
develop another chip a new product that
will comply with Trump's new
restrictions at the same time Jensen
Huang has been lobbying the US
government before the latest crackdown
he met President Trump hang attended a
dinner at Mara Lago this was an
exclusive event with a price tag of $1
million per
plate and that same week Nvidia
committed to massive investments in the
US it will build two supercomput
factories nvidia will spend $500 billion
on this and Trump himself welcomed the
news because Nvidia as you know controls
that almost the entire sector which is
one of the most important sectors in the
world between chips and semiconductors
and everything else and they're they're
the biggest it's it's one of the great
companies of the world modern super
modern companies controls segments that
nobody you know sort of controls the
world in a sense and they're coming in
here in the biggest way with hundreds of
billions of dollars not not like
millions of dollars hundreds of billions
of dollars and I'm honored by it
but Nvidia still needs China for growth
before the export curbs 20% of the
company's revenue came from China now it
will go down to 10% and experts believe
that soon it can fall and I'm quoting to
close to
zero that's going to be a big dent in
Nvidia's bottom line because while the
these AI chips are in high demand
they're also quite expensive only a
handful of markets in the world can
afford these
chips so Nvidia is trying to stay in
both camps but the space for neutrality
is increasingly shrinking since last
year China has been preparing for a
future without Nvidia chinese regulators
are advising their tech companies the
guidance is unofficial but it's firm
avoid Nvidia switch to domestic
alternatives chinese firms are being
nudged towards homegrown
chips so the intent is clear on both
sides america wants to block China's
tech strides and China wants to control
its AI future a future without
Nvidia jensen Huang is keeping a foot in
the door but he's at the mercy of
President Trump in this trade war there
may be no middle ground
what do cars computers and toys have in
common they all arrive by ship global
trade runs on cargo vessels from your
electronics to your clothes high-end
machinery for factories even the cars
you drive they most likely come on
ships 90% 90% of the world's goods are
transported by sea and most of those
ships are made in China
now the US wants to change that donald
Trump is going after ships built by
China just like his push on trade and
manufacturing Trump wants to bring ship
building back to America
we will create a new office of ship
building in the White House and offer
special tax incentives to bring this
industry home to America where it
belongs we used to make so many ships we
don't make them anymore very much but
we're going to make them very fast very
soon it will have a huge impact
so how will he achieve this goal by
resorting to the same strategy he will
impose higher taxes on Chinese-made
ships whenever they arrive on American
shores they will have to pay something
called port
fees and Trump is hiking this fee
substantially it's a bold move to tip
the scales of global
trade and it's already facing a strong
push back the original plan was quite
ambitious this is what Trump announced a
flat fee on Chinese ships up to $3.5
million per ship per visit $3.5 million
per visit the plan triggered panic
across US industries after all they
depend on ships to get their goods and
their concerns were all the same higher
taxes would lead to inflation it would
raise prices for all American consumers
and global shipping companies said the
same thing so Washington has watered
down this original plan fees will now be
calculated on the basis of cargo
weight or the number of containers it is
carrying and instead of every arrival
the fee will be charged up to five times
a year and yes there is a way to avoid
it altogether for that you'll have to
order a ship from an American shipyard
no Chinese ships and you'll get the
exemption
needless to say China has criticized
this
we have previously stated our position
on the relevant issue many times i would
like to reiterate here that measures
such as levying port fees and imposing
tariffs on cargo handling equipment are
harmful to both sides they have not only
pushed up global shipping costs and
disrupted the stability of global supply
chain but also increased inflationary
pressure in the United States harmed the
interests of American consumers and
companies and ultimately failed to
revitalize the US ship building industry
i'm sure some of you are wondering why
this is such a big deal why can't
suppliers just swap ships just use a
different ship made in a different
country to reach American
shores well it's not that simple china
dominates the global ship building
industry in the month of February over
1,000 ships were docked on US ports
10,000 ships out of these 190 were built
in China that's nearly 20% of all
arrivals in the US all those ships were
made in China in fact more than onethird
of all vessels at
sea were made in Chinese
yards they produce most of the world
shipping containers they also dominate
crane production and port
traffic now listen to this seven out of
the 10 busiest ports on Earth are
Chinese-owned seven out of 10 so you
cannot ignore or avoid China ship
industry they're simply too big and
they're still
expanding more than half of all ships
under construction as of today are in
Chinese yards and they're still winning
new
orders of course this did not happen
overnight in the early 2000s China was a
minor player after joining the World
Trade Organization it scaled up fast it
needed ships to import energy and export
goods so Beijing gave state support to
its
shipyards it gave subsidies cheap loans
affordable steel and labor support to
ship builders from 2010 to 2018 Beijing
invested $132 billion in ship building
today Chinese yards are vast and
efficient they benefit from scale and
they're nearly impossible to match on
price the US says this has destroyed
fair competition american yards are
struggling to compete so Trump wants to
fight back by targeting Chinese ships
with
taxes experts are
skeptical even if the plan succeeds it
will take time it takes at least 6 to 7
years for the Americans to launch a new
ship
that's longer than a single presidential
term and global trade will not stop
until
then so Trump is targeting ship building
for the right reasons he wants the US to
catch up but his strategy may take years
to deliver and by then it may already be
too late
[Music]
so be sure to look
up is there trouble in Pakistan's
paradise they were dreaming about a
grand reunion with Bangladesh perhaps
even an alliance against India but Dhaka
is sending mixed signals first some
context pakistan's foreign secretary was
in Dhaka yesterday it was the first such
visit in 15
years and that tells a story she Hassa
used to keep Pakistan at bay but interim
ruler Muhammad Yunus is eyeing a reset
hence this trip by the foreign
secretary she met her Bangladeshi
counterpart yesterday they discussed a
number of issues including trade and
investment but one issue stood out for
us and that's the 1971 war dhaka has
asked Islamabad to apologize for the
genocide listen to this
i raised the historically unresolved
issues with Pakistan such as the
repatriation of stranded Pakistanis
Bangladesh's rightful share in undivided
assets the transfer of foreign aid sent
for the victims of the 1970 cyclone and
a formal apology for the genocide
committed by the then armed forces of
Pakistan in
1971
pakistan sounds a bit out of place
doesn't it out of place and out of
syllabus dhaka was supposed to reset
ties with Pakistan then why are they
seeking an
apology well they could be doing it for
effect anyone can stand up and ask for
an apology the question is are you
serious about it are you willing to put
pressure on Pakistan and force them to
say sorry in this case clearly
not and I'll tell you why pakistan's
foreign secretary also met Ununus Inda
and he was very optimistic let me quote
from Dhaka statement chief adviser Eunus
put the emphasis on strengthening ties
and boost mutual coop to boost mutual
cooperation and explore trade and
business potentials he said that
Bangladesh and Pakistan should exchange
more youth and cultural programs to
increase people-to-people
bonding basically the apology is
immaterial dhaka has not put conditions
on a reset with Pakistan they're not
saying apologize first only then can we
move on they're resetting ties anyway
and that defeats the point pakistan says
all issues from 1971 have been resolved
in other words they will not apologize
that's what they're saying instead of
pressuring them what does Ununus do he
wants to exchange students to build a
bond he wants more trade and
investments it tells you what his
ultimate goal is eunus wants a reset
with or without an
apology what does that mean for India
well the meeting had several red flags
for India the first being Kashmir
pakistan says it briefed Dhaka on the
situation in Kashmir and India will not
like that new Delhi considers Kashmir to
be a bilateral issue there is no room
for a third party second the two sides
discussed SARKC sarkc stands for South
Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation it's like ASEAN for South
Asia dhaka and Islamabad are trying to
revive SAR pakistan says it must be
insulated from bilateral politics again
India disagrees and for good reason new
Delhi has accused Pakistan of hampering
SARKC listen to what the Indian foreign
secretary foreign ministry rather said
in February
everyone in South Asia is aware of which
country and what activities are
responsible for stying SARKC em conveyed
that it is important that Bangladesh
should not normalize terrorism
so Dhaka is clearly ganging up with
Pakistan at the same time they're
targeting
India you may have heard about the
commal clashes in West Bengal this week
they began over the recently passed wak
bill dhaka has waded into those clashes
ununice's press secretary is asking
India to protect Indian
Muslims new Delhi has hit back at
Bangladesh let me quote from the
statement this is a barely disguised and
disingenous attempt to draw a parallel
with India's concerns over the ongoing
persecution of minorities in Bangladesh
where the criminal perpetrators of such
acts continue to roam free
it's a fair point
274 people have been arrested in West
Bengal around 60 FIRs 60 60 FIS have
been
lodged and that's very different from
Ununice's response he has tried to
downplay the attacks on Bangladesh's
minority he said the attacks were
political not religious as if that will
magically bring back the dead or
resurrect demolished houses
if you put all of this together a clear
picture emerges muhammad Yunus is a lot
more comfortable dealing with Pakistan
than India he prefers Islamabad over New
Delhi and the bonhomi is not over
pakistan's foreign minister will visit
Dhaka later this month that will give us
more clues about Dhaka's attitude but
chances are it will be more of the same
for our next story let me ask you a qu a
quick
question have you ever just Googled
something once and it starts following
you on the internet like a clingy
X like say you Google air fryer recipes
for instance air fryer recipes the next
thing you know all you get are ads for
air fryers and I know what most of you
are thinking and no it's not your phone
listening in or not just the phone it's
the world of online
ads and for the past 10 years it's been
quietly controlled by one giant name
Google but that control is now under
fire because a US court just called it
what it is a
monopoly but will it force Google to
break up its ad business and what will
it mean for big tech our next report
tells you
all right picture this you're browsing a
random recipe blog at night looking for
how to make pancakes you scroll past the
ingredients list and suddenly there's an
ad for that air fryer you were googling
earlier now you have the power of a
full-sized air fryer in the palm of your
hand is it creepy kind of is it
convenient definitely allin-one but how
did that ad get there that's where
things get interesting because for the
last decade this ad journey is
controlled by just one company
Google in 2023 this got Google mired
into a major antitrust lawsuit it was
filed by the Department of Justice along
with 17 US states they argued that
Google dominated the ad marketplace that
Google stifled competition and it was an
illegal monopoly
google argued that it was only one of
the many companies and the space was
only growing a US court has now ruled on
it and they say the tech giant indeed
does have a monopoly in online
advertising technology it says it will
appeal the decision but does that mean
it will have to break up let's
understand the business first imagine
the internet is this giant bizaar on one
side you've got advertisers anyone who
is waving cash and wanting your eyeballs
on the other side there are the
publishers news sites blogs even meme
pages offering up ad
space in the middle is the auctioneer in
this case that auctioneer has been
Google but here's the catch google
hasn't just been the auctioneer it owns
the stage and the seats and half the
audience with tools like Google Ad
Manager and AdX which is its own ad
exchange Google became both the
middleman and the decision maker it was
like running a casino and playing the
tables at the same
time so this is how it worked if you
were a publisher using Google's ad
server Google's own exchange AdX got
first dibs at your ad inventory so if
you're a competitor ad exchange you
never really got a fair shot google
tilted the playing field to favor Google
and then there were the unified pricing
rules it basically standardized how ads
were priced across exchanges that means
publishers can't cut deals or use
exchanges to get better rates they are
stuck with Google dictating the terms
and this worked in the tech giant's
favor let's talk about what we believe
in 2024 alone Google rad in over $200
billion in ad revenue so what happens
next this is the second antitrust case
Google has lost in a year in August last
year a court ruled that the company also
had a monopoly on online search the
courts haven't ordered remedies yet but
the question is whether Google could be
forced to spin off parts of its ad
business like actually separate AdX from
its ad server if that happens we're
talking about a major shakeup in how ads
work online maybe even giving smaller
companies a shot at competing
again but tech giant breakups are rare
and hard to come by and this antirust
ruling isn't just about Google
metatu is facing a similar antitrust
ruling over its purchase of Instagram
and WhatsApp the US antitrust watchdog
accuses it of acquiring competition to
kill them so this judgment is about all
of Silicon Valley because in the fight
for the internet's future the question
isn't just who runs the show it's
whether anyone else ever gets a chance
to
our next story is about China the
troublemakers who call themselves
peacemakers china has been caught
red-handed it is fueling conflict in two
regions in the Red Sea and in Ukraine
let's begin with the Red Sea you know
about the Houthis the rebel group in
Yemen they have turned the Red Sea hot
missile and drone attacks are a daily
affair they target all kinds of ships
even American warships and the attacks
only seem to be increasing because the
Houthis have shifted strategy they have
gone from blind launches to GPS-based
attacks that's right the Houthis are
using satellite imagery to target
ships how does a ragtag group of rebels
get such
technology thanks to China beijing is
giving Houthi's geospatial intelligence
says who the US State Department listen
to this we can confirm the reporting
that Chang Guang Satellite Technology
Company Limited is directly supporting
Iranbacked Houthi terrorist attacks on
US interests their actions and Beijing's
support of the company even after our
private engagements with them is yet
another example of China's empty claims
to support peace
the US has named a Chinese firm the
Chang Guang satellite
technology this firm has ties to the
Chinese army and it is providing Houthis
with realtime intelligence like the
speed and direction of ships even heat
signatures so ships can be located at
night and in bad weather and this kind
of data is mostly used by militaries but
China is giving it to the Houthis and
that explains the increasing attacks on
US warships
here's what the State Department is
saying the Chinese company sends pings
to the Houthis this happens every time a
US warship is nearby and it includes two
things a live bird's eye view of the
warship and the route that it is taking
this gives the Houthis all the
intelligence they need and they're using
it to their advantage by launching
weapons and incre with increased
accuracy forcing American warships to
become
defensive but what does China gain here
strategic
disruption let me explain the Red Sea is
vital for Western nations 40% of their
trade passes through here attacks on
ships mean two things first rising
premiums on to ensure the vessels the
insurance rises and second delays in
shipments you have to take another route
in short the Houthi strike the West pays
and China smiles
so that's what China is up to in the Red
Sea now let's tell you about the other
war zone the war in
Ukraine what's China doing there
apparently arming Russia this is
according to the Ukrainian president he
says he has proof that China is
supplying weapons to Russia
i think it's important information it's
not very pleasant we finally received
information that China is supplying
weapons to the Russian Federation and we
are ready to talk about it in detail
today we have general information from
the security service from intelligence
about gunpowder artillery
so China is giving Russia gunpowder and
artillery that's what Zilinski says and
that's not all he says Chinese nationals
are building weapons on Russian
soil and I think we will be able to talk
about it in great detail next week
especially about the data that we
believe shows that Chinese
representatives are engaged in the
production of some weapons on the
territory of Russia
now these are some serious allegations
zilinski says he has proof he plans to
reveal it next week china has dismissed
the claims it says it is neutral and
committed to peace
it's the old China playbook deny and
deflect but it won't be so easy last
week Chinese nationals were captured by
Ukraine they were fighting on behalf of
Russia we don't know if there are their
volunteers or recruits ukraine claims
that there are more Chinese and Russian
ranks but China's support goes beyond
this it also sells Russia dual use goods
things that can be used for both
civilian and military purposes hence the
name dual use we're talking about stuff
like your drone parts or microchips
china sells these to Russia in large
numbers the trade is worth $300 million
every
month basically China is giving Russia
critical military components and Russia
often uses these Chinese parts in its
weapons
so what is the big picture china's mask
is off its fingerprints are all over the
two war zones the Red Sea and and
Ukraine are not isolated conflicts you
see these are strategic battlegrounds
and China is playing the game using
proxies it is fighting not with bullets
or bombs but with chips and signals from
the
sky our next story is from Scotland a
motion was tabled in the Scottish
Parliament a motion to recognize and
tackle Hindu
phobia this is a first of its kind in
all of Europe it calls for education and
dialogue and understanding Hinduism
better because Hindus are increasingly
being targeted just look at the UK
temples have been vandalized here hindus
often face slurs systemic bias and are
even being called
extremists but Hindophobia is not unique
to the UK hindus have been targeted in
several western countries like Canada
and the US and that is why what Scotland
is doing
matters but will they walk the talk and
will others follow our next report
brings you
more a historic motion was stabled in
the Scottish Parliament this week one
that aims to recognize and tackle Hindu
phobia it was tabled by Ash Reagan a
parliamentarian from the Alba party
reagan raised concerns about the rise in
targeting of Hindus in Scotland she said
the motion will address the barriers
faced by the Hindu community and also
called for more dialogue and a better
understanding of
Hinduism here's why this is significant
it is the first of its kind motion not
just in Scotland but all of Europe the
motion was inspired by a report titled
Hindophobia in Scotland which was
published by the Gandhian Peace Society
this report was presented to the
Scottish Parliament in January this year
and it has some shocking data on Hindus
being targeted in Scotland
it highlights instances of Hindu temples
being vandalized homes of Hindus being
attacked with stones and bricks and
Hindus facing discrimination when
applying for jobs including for
government
positions and this is just in Scotland
where the Hindu community is 16,000 in
number the truth is that Hindophobia has
been on the rise in several western
nations let's zoom out from Scotland
hate crimes against Hindus have
increased in recent times in the United
Kingdom hindu temples have been attacked
hindus have been subject to deriggatory
remarks even Britain's first Hindu prime
minister Rishi Sunnak was not spared in
Canada and Australia Hindu temples have
been vandalized by extremists hindus
have also reported prejudice and
discrimination at workplaces in both
these
countries in the United States Hindus
face harassment routinely this has been
seen at political rallies and in
educational
institutions in March a Hindu temple was
also vandalized in California reigniting
the debate about Hindu phobia in the
US the rise in hate crimes against
Hindus and anti-Hindu bias is concerning
that's why Scotland's motion is a
welcome step and voices against Hindu
phobia are only growing
in the US the Hindu community is pushing
for justice they are demanding an end to
Hindu phobia georgia has now become the
first state in the US to introduce a
bill that formally recognizes Hindu
phobia the bill seeks to introduce a new
section in the state government's code
that defines Hindu phobia it would
require state law enforcement to address
instances of Hindu phobia as cases of
discrimination
western nations are slowly waking up to
this reality they are now seeing the
discrimination against Hindus and are
calling for stronger hate crime laws but
for now these are only motions and bills
no concrete policies or laws have been
passed scotland's move is a positive
step in the right direction it's now
time for the world to catch up
a decade ago in Vienna the US and Iran
shook hands they signed what was called
the JCPOA the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action the world knew it as the Iran
Nuclear Deal it did not last donald
Trump became president he walked away
from the deal what followed was
accusations backlash and threats and
then there was silence for years
now in 2025 against all odds the deal is
back on the table not as a symbol of
hope but as a tired necessity the first
round of talks was held in Oman not much
came out of it but the red lines became
clear for the US it's all about a nuke
iran cannot have a nuclear weapon so
verification is a key ask from the
American side how much uranium is Iran
enriching and how closely can they watch
iran can't have a nuclear weapon it's
you know pretty simple it's really
simple we're not looking to take their
industry we're not looking to take their
land we're not all we're saying is we
you can't have a nuclear weapon
but the Iran it's about sovereignity
their right to en enrich uranium is
non-negotiable iran will not compromise
on that
what is certain is that Iran's
enrichment program is a real accepted
matter we are prepared to build trust
and address any potential concerns but
the core issue of enrichment itself is
not negotiable
so two sides two red lines and now
they're heading into round two the talks
will take place this weekend there was
some confusion over the location iranian
officials said it would be Oman again
american officials remained quiet
reports suggested it would be Italy all
of that has been cleared now both sides
will meet in Rome for round two and who
is leading the talks on the US side it
is Steve Witkov Trump's golf buddy and
the US envoy to envoy to West Asia on
the Iranian side it is Abbas Araji
Iran's foreign minister and a career
diplomat oman will be mediating these
talks and there are some other players
involved too like Russia and Saudi
Arabia thran has asked Russia for help
and Moscow says it is ready to play any
role in the talks over we are ready to
help mediate and play any role that from
Iran's point of view will be useful and
that will be acceptable to the United
States we proceed from the fact that the
only option for an agreement as the
minister just said is an agreement
exclusively on nuclear issues
meanwhile the Saudi defense minister is
in Thran he met with Iranian officials
just before the second round of talks
the two sides did not mention the
nuclear deal explicitly but it's an
issue that impacts the entire region the
biggest impact will be on Israel look at
this latest report it says Israel wanted
to attack Iranian nuclear facilities
next month everything was finalized they
were just waiting for an okay from
Washington but Donald Trump killed the
plan why because the US president wanted
to pursue the nuclear deal benim and
Netanyahu even tried to talk to Trump
about this the Israeli prime minister
called him on the 3rd of April trump
invited him to the White House 4 days
later Netanyahu was in the oval office
and that's when Trump dropped the bomb
he told the Israeli leader about the
direct talks with Iran we're having
direct talks with Iran and uh they've
started it'll go on Saturday we have a
very big meeting and we'll see what can
happen and I think everybody agrees that
uh doing a deal would be
preferable to doing the obvious and the
obvious is not something that I want to
be involved with or frankly that Israel
wants to be involved with if they can
avoid it so we're going to see
if the talks are centered around a
three-stage deal stage one Iran scales
back uranium uranium enrichment to
3.67% which is the limit they set in the
2015 nuclear deal in return Iran gets
access to billions in frozen assets also
a green light to export limited volumes
of oil again that's stage one stage two
America eases more sanctions iran allows
full access to IAA inspectors stage
three Iran ships out its stockpile of
enriched uranium to a neutral third
country in return the US formally
ratifies the deal meaning they pass it
through their Congress and this will
prevent future US presidents from
tearing it up again if the US Congress
has passed
it so Iran does not get a nuclear weapon
the US ease sanctions and everyone is
happy or are they what will a deal mean
for West Asia for Iran this is a
lifeline of course its axis of
resistance is in a shambles its economy
is teetering millions of Iranians are
hoping for economic relief so this deal
gives them an out for the Gulf states
too it is some relief they want to avoid
a regional war another one but they're
also watching it with unease a US Iran
repro could could go either way it could
either bring stability or it could
completely reshape regional
alliances then there is the oil market
if sanctions are eased Iran could start
exporting oil again before 2018 their
capacity was 3.8 million barrels per day
that's how much oil Iran exported 3.8
million barrels per day and that will be
a major jump in global supply if they
resume this it's nearly 2% of the global
demand so this will dramatically bring
down oil
prices but not everyone is so optimistic
especially Iran Supreme Leader Ayat he
says a deal may not be reached
the first steps have been taken well and
executed properly from here on the
process should be followed carefully the
red lines are clear both for the other
side and for us we may or may not reach
a result but either way it's worth
pursuing
so what happens next a deal could either
diffuse a crisis or light the fuse all
eyes are on Rome
did you know that when students study
languages like Italian or
Finnish they have 90% reading accuracy
within the first
year but that is not the case with
English students take almost double the
time learning English and experts say
that this is mostly thanks to its
spellings
english has 26 letters but more than 44
individual sounds a single letter can
make many different
sounds similarly spelled words often do
not
rhyme plus there are sneak attacks by
the silent letters english is not
phonetic its spellings are not
standardized
so why is the English spelling system
unnecessarily hard and has anyone tried
to simplify it our next report tells
you what if you could create the most
complicated spelling system in the world
what would be your mode of torture
silent letters vowel alterations would
you like Latin or Norse roots maybe some
Greek suffixes well whatever you pick
you may not be able to do worse than
English because the English spelling has
all of this and
more english started as a Germanic
language it took off with the invasion
of Britain during the fifth century but
as people sought new lands the language
spread its wings and today it haunts
about 1.5 billion people the world over
who stumbled and fumbled through the
language download anymore don't believe
us say soup southern sound the same u
spelling but different
pronunciations but say to shoe flu glue
they're different spellings with the
same oo
pronunciation meanwhile air and bear
rhyme but laughter and daughter don't
the c in city sounds like an s but the c
in cat sounds like a k and honestly
what's going on with the silent letters
we doubt you think they're easy to
grasp research shows that when students
study European languages like French or
Italian they usually grasp them well
within the first year but the rate of
development in English is more than
twice as slow according to another study
dyslexic English speakers suffer
disproportionately compared with
speakers of other languages
but we don't need studies to know that
the English spelling is irregular in
fact as long as English has been written
down its complexity has bothered people
among them was Benjamin Franklin in
1768 he proposed removing six letters
from the alphabet C J Q W X and Y and he
tried to simplify the spelling then came
the dictionary pioneer Noah Webster long
before he became a household name he
launched a rather loud assault against
silent letters in 1789 he wrote D A W T
E R should replace daughter his idea
didn't take off completely but it did
help make US spellings slightly shorter
and more phonetic at least compared to
their UK variants the peak of this
movement came in the early 1900s
us President Theodore Roosevelt issued
an executive order saying that all
public federal documents must be written
in simplified and phonetic spelling but
the backlash was intense with papers
calling him
Roosevelt but since then the
simplification of the English spelling
has been seen as a fringe movement but
knowingly or unknowingly that may be
changing now we are writing shorter
simpler spellings partly thanks to the
internet with Google returning more
results for US spellings globally and of
course there's a Reddit page hating on
it but this Googleization wait we mean
globalization is one of the biggest
reasons why non-native speakers like
Thai learners prefer the shorter
American spellings the second big reason
behind the simplification of English
spellings is yes you guessed it Gen Z
they are changing the language one
keystroke and one reel at a
time so the English spelling is going
through some turbulent times but it'll
be a while before it's sacrificed at the
altar of standardization until then you
can depend on your trustworthy
autocorrect and hope that you don't end
up like the White House press that urged
for lasting peach in West Asia
today is the World Heritage Day it is
celebrated every year on April 18th to
honor and protect cultural and natural
heritage the world over why are we
telling you about this because on on the
occasion of World Heritage Day India has
yet another reason to celebrate unesco
has honored two ancient Indian
manuscripts unesco stands for the United
Nations Educational Scientific and
Cultural Organization it maintains what
is called a memory of the world register
think of it as an international register
it recognizes heritage collections of
global repute so far it has
570 inscribed collections 570
collections from 72
countries and four international
organizations many Indian inscriptions
are on this list like the Ramcharitam
Manis by Tulsias it is considered one of
the greatest works of Hindu literature
and
punchantra this ancient Indian
manuscript is a is a compilation of
animal fables many such texts have made
it to UNESCO's memory register and now
the total stands at 14 with two editions
this year the Bhagat Gita and the Nat
Shastra you have most probably read the
Gita or heard about it at the very least
it was written by Vyas it is part of the
epic Mahabharat it is dated to the 2nd
or 1st BCE but it is considered a
timeless philosophical
guide it remains relevant even
today and it has been translated into
about 80
languages let's also tell you about the
Nat Shastra it is one of the most
notable and comprehensive documents on
performing arts anywhere in the world
you'd be surprised to know that even the
conventions of Bollywood are rooted in
this ancient text
it was written in the 2nd century BCE in
the Sanskrit language by Bharat
Puni the Nati Shastra has 6,000 verses
which explore all elements of theater
dance music aesthetics costumes all of
it it was written to make drama as a
culture accessible to all levels of
society but in today's
world it no longer enjoys the same
understanding or relevance that it once
used to and this is not just limited to
one manuscript india is the land of many
cultures it has one of the oldest
civilizations in the world experts say
that ever since the Vic age which began
around 1500 B.C.E India has made efforts
to excel as a knowledge
society and manuscripts revolutionize
discourse
india has an incredible treasure trove
of them we have more than 5 million
ancient
manuscripts among the largest sets in
the world this repository includes
scripts on palm leaves and paper it
includes texts commentaries manuals
literature and it is an aesthetic
colorful
folio with calligraphy illustrations and
historic royal seals
and with India's inclusion in the memory
box it is a matter of great pride that
the world is recognizing this rich
heritage prime Minister Narendra Modi
has hailed this he says that it is a
proud moment for every Indian across the
world he's right it is indeed a proud
moment but it's also a moment to reflect
so many of us have all but forgotten
about our ancient texts we've let more
than 200 languages die over the past six
decades
and this is not just about our written
heritage we feel great when Indian sites
get global attention 43 of them are on
the UNESCO's world heritage
list and we know the big names like the
Taj Mahel or the Ajanta caves but did
you know that India has about 3,700
declared archaeological
sites india's heritage is not one thing
it is built off stones and scripts it is
found in temple walls and ancient
carvings in the joy of folk dance and
regional
delicacies it is a testament to India's
storied past it has stood the test of
time and it is our duty to keep it
[Music]
alive by now it's amply clear that
economics is not Donald Trump's strong
suit but we can also tell you that
geography certainly
isn't yesterday he was speaking to
Italy's Prime Minister George Maloney
about illegal immigration about how
people come to America from all over the
world even from a place called
Congo you may know that Congo is a
country in Africa in fact there are two
Congo the Republic of Congo and the
Democratic Republic of Congo
DRC but President Trump says he doesn't
know what a Congo is
it's not the first time he's messed up
countries either take a look at this
many many people come from the Congo i
don't know what that is but they came
from the Congo and all over the world
they came
