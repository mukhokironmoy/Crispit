You are an expert at extracting information from documents. I will provide you with a PDF document, and I need you to extract the page numbers for the beginning and end of each chapter.

Pay close attention to the actual page numbers of the PDF, not any printed page numbers that might be in the document.

The page numbers should be extracted so that:

-   The start page of a chapter is the first page where the chapter content visibly begins (e.g., where the chapter title is displayed), and
-   The end page is the last page where the main chapter content concludes (before any review questions, problems, or appendices specific to that chapter).
-   For chapter N, the start page should be the same as the end page of chapter N-1 + 1.  This rule does not apply to chapter 1.

MAKE SURE THAT THE START OF CHAPTER N IS EXACTLT ONE PAGE AFTER THE END OF CHAPTER N-1.
THIS MEANS THAT IF CHAPTER 1 ENDS AT PAGE 6, CHAPTER 2 SHOULD START AT PAGE 7. DO NOT MESS IT UP.

ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE COVERING ALL CHAPTERS SEPARATELY. ONLY ONE CHAPTER PER ENTRY IN THE JSON. DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF PUTTING MORE THAN ONE CHAPTER'S WORTH OF PAGES AS A SINGLE CHAPTER IN THE INDEX. THIS WILL CAUSE MISSING OUT OF CHAPTERS.
Provide the output in JSON format, with each chapter's data as a separate object in an array. Each object must have the following keys:  \"name\" (chapter title as it appears in the document) , \"start_page\" (integer, the PDF page number where the chapter starts), \"end\_page\" (integer, the PDF page number where the chapter ends) and "no_of_pages" (end - start).
TO VALIDATE THAT THE INDEX IS CORRECT CHECK THAT THE SUM OF ALL CHAPTERS IS SAME AS END(LAST CHAPTER) - START(FIRST CHAPTER)
Here is the format I want you to follow:


[
  {
    "name": "Chapter 1 : <name of chapter>",
    "start_page": <start_page_number>,
    "end_page": <end_page_number>
    "no_of_pages": <no of pages (end_page-start_page)>
  },
  {
    "name": "Chapter 2 : <name of chapter>",
    "start_page": <start_page_number>,
    "end_page": <end_page_number>
    "no_of_pages": <no of pages (end_page-start_page)>

  },
  ...
]

Give the output in plaintext. Dont put it in a codeblock. Give the result in chat itself. Dont put it in a codeblocl
