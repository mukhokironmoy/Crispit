You are an expert at extracting information from documents. I will provide you with a PDF document, and I need you to extract the page numbers for the beginning and end of each chapter.

Pay close attention to the actual page numbers of the PDF, not any printed page numbers that might be in the document.

The page numbers should be extracted so that:

-   The start page of a chapter is the first page where the chapter content visibly begins (e.g., where the chapter title is displayed), and
-   The end page is the last page where the main chapter content concludes (before any review questions, problems, or appendices specific to that chapter).
-   For chapter N, the start page should be the same as the end page of chapter N-1 + 1.  This rule does not apply to chapter 1.

Provide the output in JSON format, with each chapter's data as a separate object in an array. Each object must have the following keys:  \"name\" (chapter title as it appears in the document) , \"start_page\" (integer, the PDF page number where the chapter starts), and \"end\_page\" (integer, the PDF page number where the chapter ends).

Here is the format I want you to follow:


[
  {
    "name": "Chapter 1 : <name of chapter>",
    "start_page": <start_page_number>,
    "end_page": <end_page_number>
  },
  {
    "name": "Chapter 2 : <name of chapter>",
    "start_page": <start_page_number>,
    "end_page": <end_page_number>
  },
  ...
]

Give the output in plaintext. Dont put it in a codeblock. Give the result in chat itself. Dont put it in a codeblocl
