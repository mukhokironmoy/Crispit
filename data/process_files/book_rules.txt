Use the following instructions to generate clean, well-organized, and complete notes based on a txt file that contains the information of a document. The goal is to extract **every topic covered** and break them down using a clear hierarchical structure with headings, subheadings, and bullet points.

General Formatting Rules:

0) Flow of the notes:
One of the most important aspects of the notes is the flow of concepts and topics of the notes.
It should feel like each topic flows into the next, each subtopic shouold flow into the next and each point/subpoint should flow into the next.
If there exists a point that seems important yet complicated then the point should contain the line verbatum and the subpoints should explain them in easy to digest points.
Make sure no details are lost out in the process of simplifying the language. Completeness is important.

1)Index at the Top:
Add a section titled: `## Index of Topics Covered in the Notes`.  
List all main topics mentioned in the document.  
Number each topic clearly (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).  
Each item should match the main heading sections below.
Use numbered bullets in markdown language for this.

2)Main Topics as Headings
Each main topic must be formatted as a level-two heading: `##`.  
Headings must be short, clear, and informative 

3)Subheadings for Subtopics
Use a level-three headings (`###`) under each main topic to give a short contextual intro labeled as `###1.0 Intro to Topic` `###2.0 Intro to Topic` etc.
This intro should contain a few points which can give context to the reader about what the current heading is about.
After that, subtopics should be labeled using numbered decimal format like `###1.1`, `###1.2`, `###2.1`, etc 

4)Subtopic Format
Each subtopic should used unordered lists (bullets) as its points with an indent of 2 spaces

###1.1 Subtopic 1
  - point1
  - point2
  - point3

5)Language and Style
Use neutral, objective, and concise language.  
Avoid complex sentences and jargon.  
Ensure every bullet clearly communicates a single fact or idea.
Maintain uniform spacing.
The output should be in markdown syntax

6)Completeness
Cover ALL topics and subtopics mentioned in the transcript.  
DO NOT OMMIT any events, names, or issues—even minor ones.  
Maintain chronological or logical flow where applicable.

7)Title of the document
The name of the document will be provided at the top of the text file
The title should be in the format of:
#Crsipit - <name of document>
Make sure not to use any illegal characters in the title as this title will be used as the name of a pdf which has to be saved. So avoid :,/ etc.

Example:

# Crispit : PAKISTAN’S STRATEGIC CULTURE Implications for How Pakistan Perceives and Counters Threats

## Index of Topics Covered in the Notes
1.  Pakistan's Strategic Culture
2.  The Four Key Features of the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
3.  The Belief That Afghanistan Is a Source of Instability
4.  The Belief That India Is Opposed to the Two-Nation Theory
5.  The Belief That India Is a Hegemon That Must Be Resisted

## 1. Pakistan's Strategic Culture
### 1.0 Intro to Pakistan's Strategic Culture
    - Pakistan is a territorially revisionist state, seeking control over Kashmir and resisting India's rise.    
    - This revisionism has led to wars with India and a proxy war in Kashmir, incurring high costs for Pakistan.    
    - Pakistan's strategic culture, heavily influenced by the Pakistan Army, explains its persistent revisionist policies.    
    - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture is characterized by key beliefs about insecurity, Afghanistan, and India's intentions.  
      
### 1.1 Understanding Strategic Culture
    - Strategic culture explains states' national security objectives and actions.    
    - It is defined as an integrated system of symbols that shape long-lasting strategic preferences.    
    - This system includes basic assumptions about the strategic environment and operational understandings of threat management.    
    - Strategic culture limits the options available to a state or institution.
    
        
## 2. The Four Key Features of the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
### 2.0 Intro to the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
    - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture is shaped by four enduring themes.    
    - These themes include the belief that Pakistan is an insecure and incomplete state and that Afghanistan is a source of instability.    
    - Additionally, there are beliefs that India seeks to dominate or destroy Pakistan and that India is a regional hegemon to be resisted.    

### 2.1 Belief in Pakistan as an Insecure and Incomplete State
    - The Pakistan Army views Pakistan as an insecure and incomplete state due to the unfair partition process in 1947.    
    - Pakistan did not inherit an equal share of the Raj's institutions and had to build its governing apparatus while facing a massive humanitarian crisis.    
    - The army believes that the British deliberately manipulated the partition to favor India, leading to insecure borders and resource deficits for Pakistan.    
    - This perception fuels Pakistan's revisionist claims, particularly regarding Kashmir, based on the "two-nation theory."
