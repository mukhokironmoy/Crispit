## 1. Pakistan's Revisionist Aims and Strategic Culture
### 1.0 Intro to Pakistan's Revisionist Aims and Strategic Culture
  - Pakistan's foreign policy is driven by revisionist goals: securing control over disputed Kashmir territory and hindering India's global rise.
  - This has led to multiple wars with India and a persistent proxy war in Kashmir, resulting in significant costs.
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture significantly influences these policies.
  - Understanding this culture is crucial for managing the threat posed by Pakistan.

### 1.1 Pakistan's Revisionism
  - Pakistan seeks to control all of Kashmir despite not having the legal right to it under the 1947 partition agreement.
  - Pakistan aims to impede India's rise in the international system.
  - This has led to wars in 1947-48, 1965, and 1999, and a prolonged proxy war in Kashmir.
  - These actions have imposed high economic and social costs on Pakistan, yet the goals persist.
  - Game theory suggests Pakistan should seek accommodation with India to minimize future costs, but this hasn't occurred.
  - The Pakistan Army's dominant role in decision-making explains this persistent revisionism.


## 2. The Strategic Culture of the Pakistan Army
### 2.0 Intro to the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture shapes Pakistan's national security and foreign policy.
  - The army uses ideological and civilizational narratives to frame threats.
  - It views its conflict with India as a clash between "Muslim Pakistan" and "Hindu India".
  - The army's strategic culture includes four key beliefs influencing its actions.


### 2.1 Strategic Culture Defined
  - Strategic culture explains a state's security objectives and choices.
  - It's a system of symbols (language, metaphors, etc.) creating enduring strategic preferences.
  - This system includes assumptions about the threat environment and preferred means of response.
  - Analyzing strategic culture helps understand limitations on a state's choices.



## 3. Four Key Features of the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
### 3.0 Intro to the Four Key Features
  - Four central beliefs underpin the Pakistan Army's strategic culture:
    - Pakistan's inherent insecurity and incompleteness.
    - Afghanistan as a source of instability.
    - India's opposition to Pakistan's existence and the "two-nation theory".
    - India as a regional hegemon that must be resisted.


### 3.1 Belief in Pakistan as an Insecure and Incomplete State
  - The army perceives Pakistan as insecure and incomplete due to the 1947 partition.
  - It believes Pakistan received fewer resources and institutions compared to India.
  - The army alleges British manipulation during partition, leading to insecure borders and resource deficiencies.
  - This perception reinforces Pakistan's claim to Kashmir based on the "two-nation theory."

### 3.2 Belief That Afghanistan Is a Source of Instability
  - The army sees Afghanistan as a source of instability, often in collusion with India.
  - This perception dates back to Afghanistan's actions after Pakistan's independence.
  - Afghanistan's rejection of the Durand Line, irredentist claims, and support for separatists fueled this view.
  - The belief in Indo-Afghan collusion persists, contributing to Pakistan's strategic depth policy.

### 3.3 Belief That India Is Opposed to the Two-Nation Theory and Seeks to Dominate or Destroy Pakistan
  - The army believes India fundamentally opposes Pakistan's existence as a Muslim state.
  - This view traces back to early leaders like Ayub Khan, who saw India's actions as pathological.
  - India's victory in the 1971 war reinforced this belief.
  - This continues to drive the army's narrative and actions.

### 3.4 Belief That India Is a Hegemon That Must Be Resisted
  - The army sees India as an aspiring regional hegemon threatening Pakistan and its neighbors.
  - This view is reflected in Pakistani military publications, depicting India as a threat since independence.
  -  This belief reinforces Pakistan's need to resist India's influence and maintain its independence.


## 4. Operationalizing and Managing Threats
### 4.0 Intro to Operationalizing and Managing Threats
  - The Pakistan Army employs various strategies to address the four core beliefs of its strategic culture.
  - These strategies include the instrumentalization of Islam, asymmetric conflict, and developing external ties.
  - Maintaining a forward or close border policy with Afghanistan is another key strategy.
  - The use of proxy fighters under a nuclear umbrella remains a core element of the approach.


### 4.1 Operationalizing the Belief in Pakistan as an Insecure and Incomplete State
  - The army aims to defend Pakistan's ideological and geographical frontiers.
  - It seeks to complete the partition process by acquiring Kashmir.
  - The "two-nation theory" remains a central ideological justification for these actions.
  - Islam is instrumentalized to build national character, attract recruits, and justify the conflict with India.
  - This ideology sustains popular support for endless conflict and the army's dominant role.

### 4.2 Operationalizing the Belief That Afghanistan Is a Source of Instability
  - The policy of "strategic depth" involves cultivating pro-Pakistan regimes in Afghanistan.
  - This involves political influence rather than solely military presence.
  - Pakistan uses Islamist groups in Afghanistan to counter Indian influence and maintain control.
  -  This strategy dates back to the 1970s and has involved training and supporting various Islamist militant groups.

### 4.3 Operationalizing the Belief That India Is Opposed to Pakistan's Existence and the Two-Nation Theory
  - The army sustains public support for a perpetual civilizational war against India.
  - It frames conflicts as defensive jihads, portraying India as an ideological and theological enemy.
  -  This narrative justifies Pakistan's actions and reinforces the army's role in securing Pakistan's survival.

### 4.4 Operationalizing the Belief That India Is a Hegemon That Must Be Resisted
  - Pakistan uses proxy warfare and the nuclear umbrella to challenge India.
  - This strategy is relatively inexpensive, offering plausible deniability.
  - The nuclear arsenal is used to blackmail and deter actors, including the US, and gain international support.
  -  The pursuit of battlefield nuclear weapons further complicates the situation and increases the risk of escalation.



## 5. Conclusions and Policy Implications
### 5.0 Intro to Conclusions and Policy Implications
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture is deeply entrenched and unlikely to change easily.
  - Traditional US approaches of aid and assistance have failed to alter Pakistan's behavior.
  -  A new approach is needed to dissuade Pakistan from using Islamist terrorism and to curb its nuclear ambitions.

### 5.1 The Need for Compellence
  - Pakistan lacks disincentives to use Islamist terrorism and pursue reckless nuclear technologies.
  - The international community has not effectively held Pakistan accountable for its actions.
  - A compellence strategy is needed to change Pakistan's cost-benefit calculus.

### 5.2 Policy Recommendations
  - The US should remove itself from Pakistan's nuclear coercion loop by holding it accountable for nuclear security and proliferation.
  -  The US should cease providing positive incentives for Pakistan's support of militant groups.
  -  The US should be willing to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism and impose sanctions if necessary.
  - The US should review all forms of bilateral and multilateral economic support to Pakistan.
  -  The US should avoid language that legitimizes Pakistan’s claims on Kashmir in official statements.
  - The US should consider officially supporting converting the Line of Control into the international border.

### 5.3  The Need for a New Approach
  - Given the enduring nature of Pakistan's strategic culture, the US must abandon its past policies.
  - A new approach is needed that involves stronger compellence and a willingness to accept greater risks.
  - The status quo is unsustainable; new strategies are needed to manage Pakistan's revisionist actions and its nuclear program.
