## 1. Pakistan's Revisionist Goals and Strategic Culture
### 1.0 Intro to Pakistan's Revisionist Goals and Strategic Culture
  - Pakistan's foreign policy is driven by revisionist aims: securing control over disputed Kashmir territory and hindering India's global rise.
  - This has resulted in costly wars and a prolonged proxy war in Kashmir.
  - Despite the high costs, these revisionist goals persist, driven by the Pakistan Army's strategic culture.
  - This report focuses on the Pakistan Army's role due to its dominance in national security and foreign policy decision-making.

### 1.1 Pakistan's Revisionism
  - Pakistan's revisionism includes territorial claims (Kashmir) and a desire to counter India's growing international influence.
  - This has led to multiple wars with India (1947-48, 1965, 1999) and a continuous proxy war in Kashmir (starting in 1989).
  - These actions have imposed significant economic and social costs on Pakistan.
  - Despite evidence of failure, Pakistan continues its revisionist policies, defying rational strategic calculations.

### 1.2 Strategic Culture as an Explanation
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture plays a significant role in explaining Pakistan's persistent revisionism.
  - Strategic culture shapes a state's security objectives and the means chosen to achieve them.
  - It involves deeply rooted beliefs about the strategic environment and effective strategies.
  - This report analyzes the Pakistan Army's strategic culture to understand its impact on Pakistan's actions.



## 2. The Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
### 2.0 Intro to the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture significantly shapes Pakistan's security perceptions and actions.
  - It influences both foreign and domestic policies related to national security.
  - The army's views are often presented as the nation's strategic outlook, given its extensive influence.
  - Analysis focuses on the army's published works and official statements to understand their strategic culture.

### 2.1 Defining Strategic Culture
  - Strategic culture explains a state's security goals and actions through a system of symbols (language, analogies, metaphors).
  - These symbols shape lasting preferences regarding military force in international affairs.
  - Key components include core beliefs about the strategic environment and preferred methods for managing threats.
  - Understanding this culture helps explain why Pakistan chooses specific actions over alternatives.


## 3. Four Key Features of the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
### 3.0 Intro to Four Key Features of the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
  - Four core beliefs underpin the Pakistan Army's strategic culture.
  - These are deeply ingrained and influence the army's approach to threats and strategic goals.
  - These beliefs are consistently found in official military publications and statements.
  - They shape Pakistan's actions towards India and Afghanistan.


### 3.1 Insecurity and Incompleteness of Pakistan
  - The army views Pakistan as insecure and incomplete due to the 1947 partition.
  - This perception stems from unequal division of resources and institutions from British India.
  - It believes the British deliberately disadvantaged Pakistan, creating insecure borders.
  - This fuels Pakistan's revisionist goals, particularly concerning Kashmir and the "two-nation theory."

### 3.2 Afghanistan as a Source of Instability
  - The army considers Afghanistan a source of instability, often in collusion with India.
  - This perception stems from historical grievances, including Afghan territorial claims and support for separatist movements.
  - Pakistan’s "strategic depth" policy aims to influence the Afghan government to be favorable to Pakistan and hostile to India.
  - This includes using Pakistan's western border regions as a buffer zone.


### 3.3 India's Opposition to Pakistan's Existence
  - The army believes India is fundamentally opposed to Pakistan's existence as a Muslim state.
  - This belief stems from India's rejection of the "two-nation theory" and past conflicts.
  - The army views India as having hegemonic ambitions and seeking to undermine or destroy Pakistan.
  - This shapes Pakistan's perception of India as an existential threat.

### 3.4 India as a Hegemon to Be Resisted
  - The army sees India as a regional hegemon aiming to dominate Pakistan and its neighbors.
  - This belief is reflected in Pakistan's military publications and official statements.
  - It underscores Pakistan's need to resist India’s influence and ambitions in the region.
  - This fuels Pakistan's assertive foreign policy and military build-up.


## 4. Operationalizing and Managing Threats
### 4.0 Intro to Operationalizing and Managing Threats
  - The Pakistan Army operationalizes its strategic beliefs through specific actions.
  - It uses various tools to manage the perceived threats.
  - The instruments include political Islam, asymmetric warfare, and nuclear deterrence.
  - The effectiveness and cost of these tools are analyzed in the context of their strategic culture.

### 4.1  Defending Ideological and Geographic Frontiers
  - The army sees its role as defending both Pakistan's territory and its Islamic identity ("two-nation theory").
  - It portrays conflicts with India as defensive jihads, justifying actions through religious narratives.
  - The use of Islamic ideology aims to build national unity and support for the military’s actions.
  - This strategy links the army's role directly to Pakistan's survival and its Islamic identity.


### 4.2 Using Non-State Actors
  - Pakistan has a long history of employing non-state actors, especially Islamist militants.
  - These are used in proxy conflicts, particularly in Kashmir and Afghanistan.
  - The nuclear umbrella provides a level of impunity for these actions.
  - This strategy allows Pakistan to engage in low-intensity conflict with limited accountability.


### 4.3 Pursuit of Strategic Depth in Afghanistan
  - Pakistan's "strategic depth" policy aims to control the political landscape of Afghanistan.
  - It involves supporting various groups (primarily Islamists) to counter Indian influence.
  - This strategy uses political Islam and militancy to shape Afghan politics.
  - The policy has contributed to instability in Afghanistan and wider regional consequences.


### 4.4 Battlefield Nuclear Weapons
  - Pakistan’s development of tactical nuclear weapons aims to deter conflict with India.
  - This strategy is built on maintaining a state of uncertainty and ambiguity (instability-instability paradox).
  - The intent is to deter India by creating the fear of escalation to nuclear conflict.
  - This exacerbates regional instability and increases the risks associated with nuclear proliferation.


## 5. Implications and Policy Recommendations
### 5.0 Intro to Implications and Policy Recommendations
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture creates significant challenges for international efforts to manage the threat from Pakistan.
  - Traditional approaches of aid and engagement have proven largely ineffective.
  - A new approach is needed to address Pakistan's behaviour, taking into account its deeply rooted beliefs and practices.
  - Policy recommendations focus on compelling Pakistan to change its cost-benefit analysis on terrorism and nuclear proliferation.


### 5.1 Addressing Pakistan's Nuclear Program
  - The US should remove itself from Pakistan's nuclear coercion loop.
  - Pakistan should be held solely responsible for nuclear security incidents, deterring reckless behavior.
  - Stronger sanctions and countermeasures against the nuclear program are considered necessary.
  - The US should threaten punitive action if Pakistan uses nuclear weapons first.


### 5.2 Curbing Support for Militant Groups
  - The US should stop reimbursing Pakistan for counter-terrorism efforts, pushing for a more independent approach.
  - Providing only counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency training, without broader military support, can align assistance with genuine needs.
  - Designating Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism, unless substantive steps are taken against militant groups, is a potential measure.
  - A timeline of concrete actions against militant groups, including the eventual eradication of these groups, is vital.


### 5.3 Using Negative Inducements
  - Targeting individuals supporting terrorist groups through international prosecution, sanctions, and travel restrictions can be effective.
  - UNSCR 1373 and 1267 can be utilized to target specific individuals and their financial networks.
  - This requires international cooperation and could include diplomatic pressure on countries, such as China, that shield terrorists.
  - Combining diplomatic pressure with sanctions and targeting individuals can curtail Pakistan's support for terrorism.


### 5.4 Reviewing Economic and Multilateral Support
  - The US should review bilateral economic support and pressure multilateral institutions to align funding with Pakistan’s cooperation.
  - This leverages Pakistan's dependence on financial aid, aligning assistance with improved behavior.
  - Reducing or ceasing this support could compel changes in Pakistani behaviour.
  - This requires overcoming international reluctance to use punitive measures.


### 5.5 Revising US Stance on Kashmir
  - The US should avoid making statements that portray Kashmir as a disputed territory, stopping the unintended reward for terrorism.
  - Omitting any references to Kashmir in official communication with Pakistan can deprive the country of this desired reward.
  - Considering supporting the Line of Control as the international boundary, to reduce the disputed area, could help to mitigate the conflict.
  -  A different diplomatic approach to Kashmir is needed, avoiding language that legitimizes Pakistani claims and rewards terrorism.


### 5.6 Conclusion
  - A fundamental shift in US policy towards Pakistan is necessary due to the enduring nature of the Pakistan Army's strategic culture.
  - Continuing past approaches won't yield different outcomes, necessitating a more effective and comprehensive approach.
  - New policies are needed to address Pakistan's deeply ingrained beliefs and incentives for destabilizing behavior.
  - This requires strong leadership and a willingness to accept increased risks to achieve security outcomes.
