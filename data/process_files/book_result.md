## 1. Pakistan's Revisionist Goals and Strategic Culture
### 1.0 Intro to Pakistan's Revisionist Goals and Strategic Culture
  - Pakistan's foreign policy is driven by revisionist aims:  acquiring all of Kashmir and impeding India's global rise.
  - This has resulted in costly wars and a protracted proxy war, yet these goals persist.
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture is central to understanding this behavior.
  - The Army holds significant influence over national security and foreign policy decisions.

### 1.1 Pakistan's Revisionism and the Cost of Pursuing it
  - Pakistan's revisionist goals include controlling all of Kashmir, a territory it wasn't entitled to after partition.
  - It also aims to hinder India's rise on the global stage.
  - These goals have led to multiple wars with India (1947-48, 1965, 1999) and a continuous proxy war in Kashmir (beginning in 1989), all of which Pakistan has lost.
  - This pursuit has imposed significant economic and social costs on Pakistan, including the rise of domestic militancy that now threatens the state.
  - Despite the high cost and lack of success, Pakistan's revisionist aims endure, defying game theory predictions of accommodation with India.

### 1.2 Strategic Culture as an Explanatory Framework
  - Strategic culture explains states' security objectives and the choices they make to achieve those objectives.
  - It's defined as an integrated system of symbols (language, metaphors, etc.) that creates long-lasting strategic preferences.
  - This system includes assumptions about the strategic environment and the most effective means of managing threats.
  - Strategic culture limits the range of options available to decision-makers.
  - This report focuses on the Pakistan Army's strategic culture because of its dominant role in national security decision-making.


## 2. The Four Key Features of the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
### 2.0 Intro to the Pakistan Army's Strategic Culture
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture is based on four core beliefs.
  - These beliefs shape its perception of threats and its approach to national security.
  - These deeply held beliefs are persistent and have shaped Pakistan's actions for decades.

### 2.1 Belief in Pakistan as an Insecure and Incomplete State
  - The Army views Pakistan as an insecure and incomplete state, stemming from the 1947 partition.
  - This perception is based on several factors: unequal inheritance of Raj's institutions, a massive humanitarian crisis, and perceived British manipulation of borders to favor India.
  - The belief that Britain conspired to allocate districts to India to facilitate an invasion of Kashmir is a key part of this narrative.
  -  This belief fuels Pakistan's revisionist claims, particularly its pursuit of Kashmir.

### 2.2 Belief that Afghanistan is a Source of Instability
  - The Army considers Afghanistan a source of instability, often in collusion with India.
  - This stems from historical grievances against Afghanistan and a belief in its potential to destabilize Pakistan with Indian backing.
  - Afghanistan’s early actions (rejecting Pakistan's UN bid, rejecting the Durand Line, making irredentist claims, aiding separatists) fueled this perception.
  -  India's renewed presence in Afghanistan since 2001 under the U.S. and NATO security umbrella reinforces this fear, leading to the perception of a potential two-front war.

### 2.3 Belief that India is Opposed to the Two-Nation Theory and Seeks to Dominate or Destroy Pakistan.
  - The Army believes India is fundamentally opposed to Pakistan's existence as a Muslim state.
  - This belief, rooted in historical experiences and India's victory in the 1971 war, is central to Pakistan’s understanding of its security environment.
  - This perception fuels the notion of a civilizational conflict between "Muslim Pakistan" and "Hindu India."
  - Statements by Pakistani military leaders even in recent years (2016) illustrate the persistence of this belief.

### 2.4 Belief that India is a Hegemon That Must Be Resisted
  - The Army views India as a regional hegemon that must be resisted.
  -  This belief stems from India’s perceived ambitions to dominate the region and to impose its will on its neighbors.
  - Pakistani defense publications consistently portray India as seeking to become the dominant regional power, potentially at Pakistan’s expense.
  - Pakistan’s position as a “smaller country, as the sole embarrassing stumbling block” to India’s regional ambitions fuels the sense of needing to resist.


## 3. Operationalizing and Managing Threats
### 3.0 Intro to Operationalizing and Managing Threats
  - This section outlines how Pakistan operationalizes its threat perceptions and the tools it employs to manage them.
  - The Pakistan Army's strategies are rooted in its strategic culture and aim to secure its ideological and territorial goals.
  - These tools include the instrumentalization of Islam, asymmetric warfare, and the use of proxy fighters.

### 3.1 Operationalizing the Belief that Pakistan is an Insecure and Incomplete State
  - The Army defends Pakistan's ideological and geographic frontiers; this includes the pursuit of Kashmir.
  - The "two-nation theory" remains a powerful ideology, justifying the ongoing conflict with India.
  - Instrumentalization of Islam:  Islam is used to build national character, recruit soldiers, and inspire a sense of national duty.
  - All wars with India are framed as defensive jihads, sustaining public support for conflict.
  - Use of Non-State Actors (NSAs): Pakistan has employed Islamist proxies for decades in both India and Afghanistan.

### 3.2 Operationalizing the Belief that Afghanistan is a Source of Instability
  - Pursuit of “strategic depth”:  This involved political influence in Afghanistan, seeking a regime favorable to Pakistan and hostile to India.
  - This strategy utilized political Islam and Islamic militancy, collaborating with Islamist parties to oppose Afghan regimes perceived as threats.
  - Establishment of training camps in FATA:  Provided training and logistical support to Afghan militants, including those involved in the anti-Soviet jihad.
  - The strategy aimed at preventing Indian influence in Afghanistan.

### 3.3 Operationalizing the Belief that India is Opposed to Pakistan’s Existence and the Two-Nation Theory
  -  Sustaining public and military appetite for indefinite civilizational war with India.
  - Portraying all conflicts with India as defensive jihads, maintaining the fiction that Pakistan is always reacting.
  - Use of Islamic terminology (ghazis, shaheed) to imbue the conflict with religious significance.

### 3.4 Operationalizing the Belief that India is a Hegemon that Must Be Resisted
  - Risk-taking as a preferred strategy:  Doing nothing is seen as equivalent to defeat, encouraging risk-prone behavior towards India.
  - Use of militants as a low-cost, high-impact tool of foreign policy, enabled by nuclear deterrence.
  - Nuclear blackmail: Using nuclear capabilities to coerce international actors, such as the United States, into providing aid and preventing strong actions against Pakistan’s support of terrorism.



## 4. Conclusions and Policy Implications
### 4.0 Intro to Conclusions and Policy Implications
  - The Pakistan Army's strategic culture is deeply entrenched and unlikely to change easily.
  - Traditional U.S. policies of aid and assistance have proven ineffective.
  -  New approaches are needed to compel Pakistan to change its behavior.

### 4.1 The Need for Compellence Strategies
  - Pakistan lacks disincentives to use Islamist terrorism or curb its pursuit of nuclear technologies.
  - The U.S. must develop compellence strategies to alter Pakistan’s cost-benefit calculus.  
  - This requires both compelling Pakistan to stop using Islamist militants and removing the international community from Pakistan’s nuclear coercion loop.

### 4.2 Policy Recommendations for the United States
  - Remove the U.S. from Pakistan's nuclear coercion loop: Hold Pakistan accountable for nuclear security and use of nuclear weapons.  
  - Consider sanctions similar to those used against Iran.
  -  Stop rewarding Pakistan for counterterrorism efforts:  Pakistan should not be compensated for actions a sovereign state is expected to perform.
  -  Limit military aid:  Provide only equipment and training relevant to counterterrorism, not to fighting India.
  -  Declare Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism:  Impose sanctions unless Pakistan takes concrete steps against militant groups.
  -  Target individuals supporting terrorism:  Use UN resolutions and other tools to impose individual sanctions (travel restrictions, asset seizures, visa denials).
  -  Review economic aid:  Reduce or eliminate aid from the U.S. and multilateral institutions.
  -  Stop mentioning Kashmir in official statements:  Avoid language that gives legitimacy to Pakistan’s claims on Kashmir.
  -  Consider officially supporting the Line of Control as the international border.

### 4.3 Overall Implications
  -  The enduring nature of Pakistan’s strategic culture requires a fundamental shift in U.S. policy.
  - Continuing with past approaches will likely lead to increased costs and risks.
  - A new approach is necessary to address the persistent threat from Pakistan.
